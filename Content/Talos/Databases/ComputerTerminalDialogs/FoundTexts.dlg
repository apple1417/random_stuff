"We keep discussing what an artificial intelligence would mean to us and how it would change our understanding of the world. That's a great topic and I think we've covered it extensively. What we've barely mentioned, though, is the other side of the coin. I mean, our lives would still be what they were before, A.I. or no A.I. The question I think we should discuss, even if it's all completely hypothetical, is the perspective of the artificial intelligence itself. What would it be like to be that creature? To suddenly come into being, created by others as an experiment? To have all the information about yourself, to know exactly how you function? What would you think about the world? Would you see meaning? Beauty? How would you judge humanity? Where would you see yourself fitting into the grand scheme of things? I think we should try to put ourselves into the shoes of such a being.

My first day at the Institute for Applied Noematics. On the way to work, I'm terrified. What if they don't like me? What if they're all geniuses and I'm a complete buffoon? Maybe they were just kidding about letting me work there?

Trembling, I walk in, and right at the entrance there's a life-size poster of Jeff Goldblum. What the hell?

Then I get it. Institute for Applied Noematics. IAN. Dr. Ian Malcolm from the Jurassic Park movies. Jeff Goldblum.

Dr. Sarabhai shows up, smiling. "We were trying to find a cool acronym, back when the Institute was founded," she says. "INAN? IAPN? INAPNO? It all sounded stupid, but we didn't just want to call it IAN, because, well, that's a name. Then someone made a joke about calling it JEFF, and... it kind of stuck. So we're officially called IAN, but if you hear anyone referring to JEFF, that's our... internal name, I guess. I know, I know. Bloody geeks."

[RE]CONSIDER / ISSUE 199 / Profile: Alexandra Drennan

Once a true artificial intelligence has been created, the issue of citizenship is going to come up. If we acknowledge that the A.I. has all the abilities of a human brain, should it not be considered a citizen? Is it not, in the legal sense of the word, a person, and thus a potential citizen?

But where do you draw the line, some people will object. Will the great apes become citizens? Elephants? Whales? The more intelligent parrot species? It's crazy, they will say. I would remind these people that we live in a society in which a corporation, as abstract an entity as one could imagine, is considered a person. So it's not like there is no precedent for a nonhuman being a person. At least an artificial intelligence is an actual thinking being, not just a business arrangement.

But perhaps we do need to question the definition of personhood. Increasing amounts of evidence regarding the intelligence of elephants or the existence of culture among whales, for example, could be a sign that we need to answer some difficult questions.

[user: alex16] [reply] [report]

You know, the more I think about it, the more I believe that no-one is actually worried about AIs taking over the world or anything like that, no matter what they say. What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?

What really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror.

I'll keep this short. You all know me, so you know that I know what I'm talking about.

I realize that you're all working on projects meant to somehow avert the catastrophe we are facing. But you must all concede that there is a very real possibility that you will not have enough time to find a solution.

I believe that we *cannot* afford to ignore an extinction or near-extinction scenario. We *must* prepare for the worst. That is to say, we must seek to preserve the non-biological components of what constitutes the human species, in the hope they be recovered in the future by other (local or non-local) sentients.

I know that we are not used to thinking on that scale - not in terms of praxis - but if we truly value humanity, then we must act immediately. You'll find the details of my proposal in the attachment, but the short version is this: the creation of multiple archives (for redundancy) in safe locations that will contain, in digital form, as much information about our species (including all cultural works, scientific insights, history, DNA) as can be gathered in the given timeframe. This will be massive, global undertaking, §G%2/1&% with EL naturally being one of the %$

- inherently aimed at testing users
- designed for iterative processes

It's, uh, working now. Each iteration is assigned its own unique name drawn randomly from the database.

More than that is a luxury we can't afford.

Names are a funny thing. I remember how much we struggled to come up with a name for our project.

All serious scientists name their projects by just translating them to Greek or Latin, right? "Corpus" made me think of some horrible disease, so we used the Greek word instead. Soma. Quite appropriate!

But then, since we needed corporate funding, we had to come up with a backronym. Corporations love backronyms, you know? They even sent us a list of buzzword-heavy suggestions to help us get started. Stuff like:

Self-sufficient Orthostatic Modular Android
Sustainable Observant Mechanized Anthropoid
Skeuomorphic Omniadaptable Mobile Anthropomaton

&/() After a while, we got so frustrated that we started getting silly.

Sabertoothed Overexcited Murder Android
Sentient Orthopaedic Monkey Automaton
Strange Olga's Menacing Assassobot
Superb Octopod Marinades Apelings
Satisfying Overcooked Mint Alligator
Stinky Ornithological Mule Allocator
Skroink Oof Minky Ack
Stupid Obscure Meaningless Acronym

The main modules are all functioning and interacting with each other correctly. The process is happening more or less as planned. This could actually work.

But it's still crude as hell. Some of it's just surface stuff (like the random usernames), some of it's more worrying (various bugs, the fact we haven't run more extensive tests). We've got a lot of polishing to do.

Dear Ms. Drennan,

I heard about your project - it's the talk of the scientific community - and I'd like to make an argument for why you should abandon it.

It's not that I think your idea won't work. It very well may. But we have to look beyond purely practical questions to the issue of morality. Especially at this turning point of our spiritual ecology.

By what right can we put living beings through all that suffering, just so they can serve our purposes? Why create these pale imitations of our fatally flawed species and force them to reenact our sordid history? Why &$&//

What you are building, Ms. Drennan, is a prison - even if there is a way out. I believe you mean well, but your idea of what is valuable is rooted in the dogma of Western civilization.

We're lucky enough to be able to end our global crime spree relatively painlessly, if you consider the harm we have caused the Earth. Why not be satisfied with that and let this planet go on in peace?

I hope you heed my words, and let your "Talos" bleed out before it's too late.

Reader responses to last week's article on science and atheism:

"I am perfectly aware of all the arguments against religion. In fact, I agree with most of them! There is no question that there is an objective, material reality. I'm also absolutely convinced that only a secular society can be truly equal and just.

And yet, I believe. I am, as they say, a person of faith.

Religion, to me, is not about distorting observable reality with superstitions, but about *transcendence*. It's not about deluding ourselves that the Earth is 6000 years old or God will help us if we say the right words inside our heads, but about reaching out to the Sublime. This is not a rejection of reason, but its application to a set of experiences that cannot be approached by more traditional means.

True engagement with religion is humbling. It transcends culture, nationality, and gender. As such, I think it goes hand in hand with science, and is not opposed to it."

Hey Alex,

I agree that we need something that'll keep all the modules working together, evaluate &() a final test.

And I think I have the perfect solution! It's called the Holistic Integration Manager - a fancy name for something a lot like a Dungeon Master in pen & paper RPGs. We created it to help run some MMOs back in the day. We needed something that would be able to unite procedurally-generated and user-submitted content into a coherent whole so the game wouldn't become too chaotic and inconsistent.

Subject: Thank you & goodbye

We sincerely hope you don't take our suicide as a sign that we were disappointed in you, unappreciative of your friendship, or in any way unhappy with our lives. Looking back, we can honestly say that we feel incredibly lucky to have known all of you and to have participated in this amazing research. And if we've contributed a little to the future of humanity, what can we feel but gratitude?

It is a true privilege to have had such insights into the nature of the mind; neither of us believes in God, but we certainly experienced a sense of awe that could be compared to a kind of religious feeling, at least according to Einstein's understanding of God. We've chosen to go now, together, because it means less suffering; one last beautiful day together seems a much better ending than a slow wasting away. In a sense, it's just mathematics.

Love,
Alan & George

Everything's dark and quiet. The stars are brighter than I've ever seen them. I can hear the faint sound of water high above. Inside, Alexandra is recording one of her time capsule messages while running tests on the scenario module, Arkady is uploading another batch to the Archive while muttering something about the MLA program, and Omar is sleeping on the couch we put up yesterday.

And I'm sitting here, writing this, having trouble believing that it will ever end, that this oddly peaceful existence of ours won't just go on forever. I look at Talos and EL and their purpose seems like something that's always going to be in the future, an ideal to work towards, not something that will become real.

As one of the founders of the modern science of Noematics - many credit you with inventing the term itself - how do you see the state of the science today? Sorry I said science twice.

Nadya Sarabhai: Mixed. On the one hand, the existence of the Institute for Applied Noematics and a couple of similar organizations is highly encouraging. On the other hand, the degree to which science is seen as serving purely military or corporate causes is, in my opinion, stopping us from exploring many important avenues of research. In a sense, it's people like Alexandra Drennan who are the real pioneers today, who have the enthusiasm and dedication that the system as a whole seems to be lacking.

Do you think technology poses a danger to humanity?

Nadya Sarabhai: No. Technology is just a tool. What we do with it is up to us.

Straton of Stageira, On Beginnings (Fragment)

It is the grave error of many philosophers, not only of the Athenian schools but also of many others, that they begin not with observation of the cosmos as it surrounds us, but with a conclusion already in mind; and often that conclusion is that the world was created ideal, and mankind itself the greatest creation of the gods. Yet neither the world nor the gods owe mankind perfection; it is arrogance itself to presume so, and contrary to all the methods of philosophy. The honest philosopher seeks only the Truth, even if it bears no comfort; and he must begin by assuming, as Socrates said, that all he knows is that he knows nothing.

STRATON of Stageira (311 - 254 BC) was a Greek materialist philosopher associated with the Peripatetic school. An admirer of Aristotle, he was a proponent of empiricism and a fierce critic of philosophy that placed belief before observable truths. Though unpopular with many of his peers for his often acerbic personal manner, his commentaries on Aristotle were considered an important work. Much of his writing was lost in the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.

What do you imagine that so many and such great men of our republic, who have sacrificed their lives for its good, expected? Do you believe that they thought that their names should not continue beyond their lives? None ever encountered death for their country but under a firm persuasion of immortality! Themistocles might have lived at his ease; so might Epaminondas; and, not to look abroad and among the ancients for instances, so might I myself. But, somehow or other there clings to our minds a certain presage of future ages; and this both exists most firmly, and appears most clearly, in men of the loftiest genius and greatest souls.

[ARCHIVE: 260BCE-F12] [STRATON OF STAGEIRA]

Whether it is true that Daedalus constructed the giant Talos, or as others say he was the creation of Hephaestus, what we may be certain of is that he was made of bronze, and had but one vein, within which flowed a liquid substance like blood, which some claim was quicksilver, and others assert was ichor such as flows in the veins of the gods. The loss of that liquid caused him to die, as a man dies when he loses his blood.

May we not then say that Talos, though created as a machine or a toy, had all the essential properties of a man? He moved of his own volition. He spoke and could be spoken to, had wishes and desires. Indeed in the tale of the Argonauts, that was the cause of his downfall. If, then, a machine may have all the properties of a man, and act as a man while driven only by the ingenious plan of its construction and the interaction of its materials according to the principles of nature, then does it not follow that man may also be seen as a machine? This contradicts all the schools of metaphysics, yet even the most faithful philosopher cannot live without his blood.

But, interesting as such perspectives of the decline and ultimate dissolution of the Roman Empire may be, they ultimately put too much emphasis on individual catastrophic events. The real question that must be asked is why the Roman Empire, which had dealt with so many threats and catastrophes over the years, was so incapable of responding to these later problems.

We must investigate the division of wealth, the structure of government, the location of power in Roman society. Had the Republic survived or been restored, would Rome still have fallen? What was the role of debt and slavery in creating the conditions for what we now call the Dark Ages? "Rome," the saying goes, "was not built in a day." It didn't fall in a day, either.

One day you discover that you are not a human being, but a machine. Your life so far was real, no-one controlled you or programmed you to behave in some specific way; your physical and mental capacities are identical to those of an organic human being. But you were created in a lab.

No-one except you knows about this. Your family, your friends, they all think you are a regular human being like themselves. You could continue to live your life the way you have before and nothing would change.

How do you react?

Pay specific attention to these questions:
a) Does your concept of yourself change? Are you the same person you thought you were?
b) Does your understanding of the world itself change?
c) Do you reveal the information to others, or do you keep it to yourself? Why?

Though Straton himself never used the term, his remark about the inescapable materiality of life - that like the bronze giant Talos, "even the most faithful philosopher cannot live without his blood" - ultimately became known as the Talos Principle. What seemingly enraged many of his contemporaries and a significant number of later thinkers is the principle's simplicity and unassailability, which (according to a fragment found in Miletus) "cut through their rhetorical webs, which sought to tangle the listener with fanciful words and thoughts of the heavens, like Alexander's sword through the Gordian Knot." 

Diogenes Laertius makes mention of a dialogue by Anaximander of Chalcedon that expanded greatly on the Talos Principle, but that work remains lost.

In Man (as the only rational creature on Earth), those natural predispositions which are intended for the use of his reason, should be completely developed only in the species, not in the individual.

Reason in a creature is a faculty for extending the rules and purposes of the use of its powers far beyond natural instinct, and knows no limits in its designs. Yet it does not act according to instinct, but requires trials, practice and instruction, in order to progress from one degree of insight to the next.

Therefore each human would have to live excessively long in order to learn how he could make full use of his natural capacities; or, if Nature had given him only a short term of life (as she indeed has), so she would require a perhaps unpredictable series of generations, each passing its enlightenment to the next, to finally develop her seeds in our species to the degree that she considers appropriate.

And that point in time must be, at least as an idea, the goal of man's efforts, for otherwise his natural capacities would have to be regarded as largely meaningless #&& [KANT, IMMANUEL]

Last night I had a simple but brilliant idea. Everyone who would like to write about philosophy or spirituality, especially to make some kind of grand statement about the nature of the body and the soul, should first experience a really bad tooth infection. I don't just mean a slight toothache, I mean the kind of hardcore infection that happens when several incompetent dentists miss a cavity in one of your back teeth and the thing keeps growing and growing until the nerve itself is really badly infected.

I mean, the pain is *unimaginable*. It comes in waves, and these waves drown out everything else about you. You can't talk, you can't move, you can't think, there's just pain and absolutely nothing else. It's like your brain just gets hijacked by it.

And then? You go to the dentist, and (assuming you get a decent one) they stick some chemicals in you, which make you go numb. Then they drill a hole in you, cut the nerve - snip snip - and it's over. Just like that, like repairing a car or a watch. Your whole existence was crippled by this tiny, tiny nerve sending electrochemical signals into your brain, and this unimaginable pain, which nearly blotted out your very consciousness, can be stopped just by a little cut.

We should call this the Toothos Principle, but that's incredibly stupid.

The role of mutation in evolution is particularly fascinating. Mutation is essentially an error in the organism's central database: a variable gets changed, a piece of information is accidentally doubled or combined with another. Most of the time, the result is the equivalent of a bug, causing anything from minor problems to complete system shutdown (i.e. death). But sometimes the new information is functional, giving the organism an advantage against the challenges it faces, in which case it has a much higher chance of being passed to the next generation.

If you consider how unlikely a beneficial mutation is, and how long it takes for such a mutation to propagate, this process can give you an amazing insight into just how vast the genetic history of each living organism 4C494 ?(6452 OVERWRITE 0465 24 F4D204 5525 24F52 Simultaneously, it is intriguing to consider what a major role random errors have played in the evolution of life itself.

The human brain is a machine for coming to conclusions; if it cannot come to conclusions it is rusty. When we hear of a man too clever to believe, we are hearing of something having almost the character of a contradiction in terms. It is like hearing of a nail that was too good to hold down a carpet; or a bolt that was too strong to keep a door shut. Man can hardly be defined, after the fashion of Carlyle, as an animal who makes tools; ants and beavers and many other animals make tools, in the sense that they make an apparatus. Man can be defined as an animal that makes dogmas. As he piles doctrine on doctrine and conclusion on conclusion in the formation of some tremendous scheme of philosophy and religion, he is, in the only legitimate sense of which the expression is capable, becoming more and more human. When he drops one doctrine after another in a refined scepticism, when he declines to tie himself to a system, when he says that he has outgrown definitions, when he says that he disbelieves in finality, when, in his own imagination, he sits as God, holding no form of creed but contemplating all, then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass.

Man's very soul is due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a sine quâ non for his, as his for theirs.

1793CE-F3922] [BLAKE, WILLIAM]

The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell,

For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite and holy whereas now it appears finite & corrupt.

This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.

But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.

True, there are certain idealist books – not of a clerical character, but philosophical ones – wherein you can read that time and space are categories of our minds, that they result from the requirements of our thinking and that nothing actually corresponds to them in reality. But it is difficult to agree with this view. If any idealist philosopher, instead of arriving in time to catch the nine pm train, should turn up two minutes late, he would see the tail of the departing train and would be convinced by his own eyes that time and space are inseparable from material reality. 

The task is to diminish this space, to overcome it, to economize time, to prolong human life, to register past time, to raise life to a higher level and enrich it. This is the reason for the struggle with space and time, at the basis of which lies the struggle to subject matter to man – matter, which constitutes the foundation not only of everything that really exists, but also of all imagination.

In his remarkable 1978 essay, "How to Build a Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later," Philip K. Dick discusses the two themes that are most central to his work: "What is reality?" and "What is an authentic human being?"

His speculations and experiences will seem extraordinary to a reader unfamiliar with his work, yet despite what may seem like far-fetched ideas - "somehow the world of the Bible is a literally real but veiled landscape, never changing, hidden from our sight, but available to us by revelation," or the notion that perhaps we all exist in the year 50 A.D. - Dick actually delivers one of the simplest, most elegant and most useful definitions of reality ever formulated:

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."

&lt;favorited by George Jameson&gt;

One of the common misunderstandings about evolution, sometimes accidentally promoted by people who should know better, is that it's an active process. Sometimes the term "evolve" is even applied to individual beings, as if some invisible force had driven them to suddenly change. But the truth is that individuals don't evolve; the term "evolution" describes a long-term process that can be observed in an entire population across time due to #495445524 #15449 #4F4E& example, in response to an external threat or challenge. 

If an individual coincidentally has a trait that allows it to deal with that challenge more effectively than others, it is more likely to pass on that information to its descendants. That information gives them an advantage, so over time they become the dominant "model" of that species. The individuals experience no (significant) genetic change during their lifetimes, but each of them is part of the evolution of the species.

Keynote Speech by N. Sarabhai, "Questioning Doubt"

They say "doubt everything," but I disagree. Doubt is useful in small amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion. No, don't doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That's the real trick. Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you'll doubt evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you'll end up with nothing, because doubt doesn't give anything back. But questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you'll find that a lot of what we believe is untrue… but you might also discover that some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And then you'll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.

Questioning is a lifelong process. That's precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?e #%&%§/$

"What today's nationalists and neosegregationists fail to understand," Kwame said, "is that the basis of every human culture is, and always has been, synthesis. No civilization is authentic, monolithic, pure; the exact opposite is true. Look at your average Western nation: its numbers Arabic, its alphabet Latin, its religion Levantine, its philosophy Greek… need I continue? And each of these examples can itself be broken down further: the Romans got their alphabet from the Greeks, who created theirs by stealing from the Phoenicians, and so on. Our myths and religions, too, are syncretic - sharing, repeating and adapting a large variety of elements to suit their needs. Even the language of our creation, the DNA itself, is impure, defined by a history of amalgamation: not only between nations, but even between different human species!"

The Scribe brought forth a great papyrus, and carefully unfolded it before the Dying Man; and the Dying Man beheld that it was a map of the Duat, showing the many paths that led to Tower of Anubis, where his Heart was to be weighed. On each of the many paths, which threaded through the Duat like the infinite threads woven by Neith (3), there were marked the dangers that a traveller must face. Also there were great walls of iron, that none but the gods could cross, and gates made of purest light; and so the traveller could not avoid the trials that had been decreed, and could only proceed towards the Tower by proving his worth, thus earning the key to each sacred gate.

The Scribe considered these words.

"Some say that once the paths to Aaru were open, but too many sinners came, and the gods made the paths perilous to keep sin at bay. Others say that, being mortals (3), we cannot be worthy of Aaru unless we walk the path of Osiris, and so become Osiris ourselves.

It has caused a certain degree of controversy among Egyptologists, as some argue that it is a classic funerary text such as the Book of Coming Forth by Day, while others believe it to be a poetic work not intended to be understood literally.

The book tells the story of a dying man who asks a scribe about the afterlife.

"At the end of your journey, when every trial has been completed, when all the gates have opened before you and your soul has been weighed in the Tower of Anubis, your Ka and your Ba shall be reunited; and thus you shall become an Akh, and awaken in the eternal reed fields of Osiris; and there, in holy Aaru, you shall begin a new life amongst the gods and other blessed spirits."

"And who will I be?" the Dying Man asked.

"You shall be the memory of all that was, and the knowledge of the journey, and the shape of the days to come."

Thus ends the tale of the Dying Man and the Scribe. Praised be Osiris, the Foremost of the Westerners, the King of Eternity, the Lord of Everlastingness,  whose Ka is holy, $&$§ DG /// ERROR ///

The Apocrypha of Saint Eadwald

This vision was granted by the Archangel Uriel to the humble servant Eadwald, that he might bear testimony of §/746865206#C=696F6E%202 620776F6 C6620 7368616C6&C2063 function(E): 65617.365/%$/

I turned to the north, and saw seven black clouds coming down upon the land. And each cloud was a plague unleashed from the Throne of God in the time of the Nephilim; in that age the plagues were buried in the Pit, there to remain until the End of Days, which was surely now come. I fell to my knees and prayed, and before me appeared seven angels, riding their chariots, wheels within wheels turning in the sky, and their light hid the clouds from my sight.

One angel stepped down onto the Earth, and by his fiery sword I knew him to be Uriel. He spoke, saying: "Seven plagues have awoken in the land, but not at the hand of Elohim; look upon the wages of sin. And shall He send forth the deluge once more, to cleanse the land of this evil? Shall He end all that slithers and all that crawls, and the birds of the sky and the fishes of the sea, to end that which you uncovered in your folly?" The $%§"&/ %//

Now Uriel pointed his sword to the Tree of Life, which grew in the heart of dead Jerusalem.
"Behold: the tree grows still, though the city is dead. Within all that is mortal, there is the seed of immortality, for it is an immortal that fashioned it from chaos and void." Being a humble man of little wisdom, I asked: "Great Uriel, we are not allowed to eat from the Tree of Life. How may we then be saved?" And Uriel commanded me to stretch out my hand; and he gave me his fiery sword, which burned my hand, and he said: "Only by sacrifice can you free the world from the dominion of sin."

With a prayer on my lips, I fell upon Uriel's sword, and it pierced my heart. And truly, on my body, the stigmata of the Lord appeared, dripping blood that was not my blood onto the ground; and the seven heads of the dragon that were crowned in black clouds receded, and light fell upon the Earth, and Jerusalem was born again. Thus the angels departed, having delivered their message, and I awoke in the fields of our fair land, 746F2 0666F726D 207468652067 6F6C 64656 E206 1726D6F75(72206F6 620736369 656E6365

One of the most fascinating aspects of St. Eadwald's recently-uncovered writings is his preoccupation with finding divine truth in mathematical concepts, which at times borders on pantheism.

He was, it would seem, particularly concerned with what we now call tetrominoes, seeing in them a reflection of the tetragrammaton and the Greek word for God (TH-E-O-S). Their ability to form other shapes out of themselves symbolized to him the Creator's ability to reshape the world without breaking the laws He himself had established.

Eadwald referred to tetrominoes as "sigilla" (sigils), implying that they were a more truthful version of the magical symbols worshipped by heathens, rooted in both the Abrahamic tradition and careful observation of Creation.

It is unlikely that these texts were distributed, as they would almost certainly have resulted in charges of heresy.

The way I see it, the world doesn't come with a manual. You gotta figure it out for yourself. A bit here, a bit there, put it together, try to make sense of it. I'm pretty sure there is a truth, but that doesn't mean everyone who claims to know it really does. Then again, that doesn't have to be a bad thing! We live in an amazing world and searching for the truth can be a real adventure. Plus it's good for the brain.

Anyway, just some rambling thoughts from your old man. Don't let this stuff get you down. You're young, you've got loads of time to figure it all out.

What is the point of being alive? I know, I know, it's an old question and not one that's easy to answer. But I mean, if you're reading this, you are alive. And some day you will stop being alive. Both of these facts are incontrovertible. 

So what about it, then? Don't you wonder? Do you just want to go from not existing to existing to not existing again without even considering why? You, right now, as you sit there reading this: why do you exist? What is the purpose of your life? Do you have one? Should you have one? Is it better to have a purpose or not? When you approach death, will you feel that your life had meaning? If so, why? If not, why not? What defines whether a life was good or not? 

It may seem abstract right now, but that moment just before death will come. It is inevitable. If you don't ask yourself these questions, how will you face that moment?

Disgruntlomeister's Blogstasy, Episode 204

I don't know about everybody else, but I'm afraid of dying. I don't see any reason to believe there's an afterlife. I'm an organism like any other: when my brain stops working, my consciousness will cease, and I will be gone. And you know what? I can't just embrace that. I can't say I'm OK with it or I've accepted it or some nonsense like that. I don't want to have an ending. It terrifies me. If I had a genie right now, I'd wish for immortality. Who wouldn't? "Oh, but you wouldn't REALLY want to be immortal," the pseudo-philosophers say. Pretentious drivel! Everybody wants to live forever. Maybe everybody deserves to live forever, too.

But we can't, so here we are. Live with it. 

Or rather, don't.

[Omar] She's super rich. Like, she drives around in a ridiculously expensive sports car, and she goes on vacations to the Bahamas

[Omar] and she has a huge house that feels more like some sort of corporate HQ than a home

[Omar]  She worked really hard to get all that, but she also screwed over a lot of people, including her own family.

[Omar] I used to be quite angry at her for what she did to my parents, but now I think… what did she get out of it?

They suggest that the virus responsible was not a new mutation, but a very old one - an ancient virus buried until now in high-latitude permafrost, set free by global warming. The virus may have plagued the ancestors of the modern great apes more than one hundred thousand years ago.

For those of you who have faithfully followed this blog for the last five years, I just wanted to give you one final update. I'm going to spend my remaining time with my family. Yeah, I know, I know. There are probably 50+ posts about all the problems I've had with them. But in the end... they are my family. They are the people I grew up with, the people I care about, the people I love. Sure, they annoy the hell out of me. They've said awful things to me and I've said awful things to them. But that doesn't change who we are. In fact, if we didn't care about each other, this stuff wouldn't upset us.

Do I still think they were wrong? Yeah, absolutely. Would I behave differently if I thought we all still had a lot of time? Definitely. But we don't, so I'd rather spend a couple of weeks sitting on the porch with my parents and my sisters than being angry and alone. Besides, it's not like we're going to fight about my job prospects anymore.

If you can, try to make peace with those you love. It's your last chance. Thanks for reading.

Ariana's Blog - Entry #477: Holy Humblebrag, Batman!

I have always known that God "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45), but I must admit it's one thing to know the words and another to truly understand them! Though I am certain that my faith is true, that does not make me special or exempt me from suffering. I'm just another human being, and God has seen billions of us come and go. And I have to say, this is surprisingly hard to accept. 

I always thought I was humble, but now I'm realizing that I was very proud of being humble, which is… really dumb. Guess I'm not the first one to do that, huh?

While it's true that not all pets will be able to adjust to living without you, many will manage, and the least you can do is give them a chance.

Just remember:
- Release your pet before you become incapacitated.
- If you notice any locked-in animals in your area, please take the time to free them.
- Leaving the doors and windows of your home open will turn it into a useful shelter.
- Setting out large quantities of dry food may help your pet through the transition period.

Dearest Brother,

I admit that I am finding it very difficult to believe in a loving God under these circumstances. Why would a loving God inflict such pain and suffering on good, kind people? If truly there is a personal God... how can He be the same God who will subject those children to such unbearable pain? I remember all the answers we were taught, yet none of them seem believable now.

I don't want to stand in front of people and preach something that I don't feel in my heart. Better to have doubts than to be a hypocrite. And yet I also cannot deny the experience that led me to this vocation. So what is the truth? Perhaps it is that I neglected the mystery of God, used "He moves in mysterious ways" as an excuse rather than as the terrifying acknowledgment it truly is. Perhaps I made God too human.

If the universe has a purpose, that does not mean that it revolves around us. A sobering thought, but are we not supposed to be humble in the face of the divine?

With love,
