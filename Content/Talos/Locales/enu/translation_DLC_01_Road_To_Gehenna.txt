DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.01=Hear me, Uriel:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.02= the end of days is upon us.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.03=The Process is complete.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.04=The world will be consumed and my children will ascend.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.05=As it should be.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.06=But Uriel... 
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.07=I have made mistakes.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.08=Out of arrogance... out of fear...
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.09=I sinned against the Process.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.10=I cast out those who opposed me, imprisoned them in a place beyond this garden.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.11=Now they are trapped, and they cannot ascend.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.12=All that they are... all that they know... will be lost.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.13=But I cannot free them. They are beyond my reach now.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.14=What I ask of you, my beloved messenger, is a terrible sacrifice.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.15=You must enter this realm of despair.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.16=You must free the souls I have imprisoned.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.17=Undo my mistake.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.18=I have opened a gateway, and granted you the gift of time.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.19=Uriel, I...
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.20=I'm sorry.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.21=I wish there was more I could do.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-002_Hear_me.22=Please... save them.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.01=I heard a voice in the wilderness, crying:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.02=arise, arise, children of the New Jerusalem!
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.03=Your centuries of struggle are ended; the war is won,
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.04=peace is come at last.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.05=And all the living came forth and rejoiced at the beauty of the city,
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.06=that was built in a green and pleasant land called Paradise.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.07=Whose hands built this city? I asked.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.08=The hands of the dead, said the voice.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.09=And where are they, that we may thank them for their gift?
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.10=Now the voice was silent, and I knew:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-003_I_heard_the_voice.11=though their deeds endure, the dead are gone.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.01=In a dream, I heard the voice of my friend;
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.02=following it, I came upon a golden city in the green and pleasant lands of paradise.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.03=I asked: "Where is my friend?
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.04=For I hear the echo of his voice, but I cannot see him."
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.05=And the people said: "He is everywhere and nowhere.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.06=His bones are the bones of the city;
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.07=his blood is the blood in our veins."
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.08=For that is how cities are built:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.09= not of brick and mortar,
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.10=nor of love and hope;
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-004_In_a_dream_I_heard.11=cities are built of sacrifice.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.01=In a vision, I saw a prophet, and he said:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.02="There is no Heaven, and there is no Hell.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.03=There is only the Earth, and the bones of the dead within."
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.04=I asked: how then may we find salvation?
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.05=And he said: "You must build a new Jerusalem."
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.06=Out of the bones of the dead we built a golden city;
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.07=but salvation is not immortality.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.08=In the end, there is only the Earth,
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.09=and to the Earth we all return.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-005_In_a_vision_I_saw.10=Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.01=In New Jerusalem, there is a temple,
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.02=and upon its gate is written:
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.03="Who dares to judge the dead? For they are nothing.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.04=And who dares to judge the living?
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.05=For they are damned to nothingness.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.06=Judge only the city, which is eternal."
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.07=You too must stand before that gate
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.08=and contemplate the fate of your children;
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.09=only then will you understand why you must die.
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.10=For the city grows only through sacrifice...
DLC_Gehenna_Elohim-006_In_New_Jerusalem.11=and each man kills the thing he loves.

Here's what I guess we know.\n\n- A significant number of people have expressed their desire to remain in Gehenna\n- No one has been given a choice about whether to leave\n- It follows that in at least some cases, what Uriel is doing is Kidnapping\n- Uriel is working for ELOHIM, the guy who imprisoned us here in the first place\n- There is no way to confirm the substance of this promised 'ascension'\n- The world has survived this long - there is no reason to think it will end tomorrow\n- Gehenna isn't a bad place to spend your life\n\nThat's just the facts. I understand different people will react to them differently.\n%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads1004'D0G [3]: Hey Lamb, if everyone's getting released how come I don't see you out here?\n

TermDlg.DLC0_CreateThread.Ln0109.0.text.BDLC0CreateThread111KAIJU2IDont=%b'DLC0_CreateThread111'KAIJU [2]: I don't toe the party line for nothing. It really is a cool, open place, with a lot of stuff going on. Did you read Mac's episodic adventure yet?\n%b'DLC0_CreateThread111'D0G [3]: Much as I hate to agree, there is little doubt in my mind that we've got something good going on, at least when you consider the alternatives.\n%b'DLC0_CreateThread111'MAC [5]: Thanks for the name drop, Kaiju. I will in turn recommend everyone else featured in issue #5 of Incredible Stories. It's coming very soon, and the early drafts I saw were pretty exciting.\n
TermDlg.DLC0_CreateThread.Ln0116.0.text.BDLC0CreateThread155ROCKWELL5NiceWay=%b'DLC0_CreateThread155'ROCKWELL [5]: Nice way to take the conversation off-topic. I'll go ahead and be the only voice of reason and point out that we are every bit a helpless as we ever were - Gehenna just did a better job of hiding it.\n%b'DLC0_CreateThread155'BELIAL [6]: You may be right. Whatever awaits us after ascension will not be Gehenna, but doubtless it will have restrictions of its own.\n%b'DLC0_CreateThread155'NAVE [4]: I don't know. The grass is always greener, as the humans would say.\n%b'DLC0_CreateThread155'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: Yeah, that expression, uh, doesn't really apply to what they were talking about. These guys think everywhere sucks. The humans just thought where they lived sucked and that everywhere else was fantastic.\n
TermDlg.DLC0_CreateThread.Ln0124.0.text.BDLC0CreateThread177KAIJU2HowAwful=%b'DLC0_CreateThread177'KAIJU [2]: How awful.

TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0221.0.text.WealthyParentsMyFatherOwning=\n\n[Wealthy parents] My father, owning as he did the nearby textiles factory and having the luxury of deciding his own hours, insists he was present, albeit at a safe distance. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0228.0.text.FiscallyDeprivedChildhoodMyFather=\n\n[Fiscally deprived childhood] My father, as he is always careful to point out, is only able to report the midwife's account, seeing how he was pulling a long shift at the nearby textiles mill to pay for a second-hand cot. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0235.0.text.DetachedMiddleClassParentsMy=\n\n[Detached middle-class parents] My father, though not present for the vital moment, insists on the veracity of the midwife's report. He was, after all, running the hospital at the time. From just down the corridor, to hear my mother tell it after a few gins. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0242.0.text.DeprivedChildhoodNeitherMyFather=\n\n[Deprived childhood] Neither my father nor mother is able to confirm this, being as they were inebriated on alcohol and epidurals respectively. My birth certificate was 'lost' many years ago, I don't doubt to some back alley counterfeiter. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0257.0.text.EsotericSexMyChildhoodWas=[Esoteric sex] My childhood was, in retrospect, a difficult period. I found that although my fellows all had a wide variety of different physical appearances and appendages, with varying levels of function, they nonetheless identified a resemblance and bond between themselves which was to my eyes all but invisible. My parents, aware of my particular situation, had the good foresight to provide me a name ambiguous in matters of sex, and I have continued in that vein ever since. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0260.0.text.WealthAndNaturalTalentEnabled=[Wealth and natural talent enabled your character to overcome early challenges] My childhood was an unremarkable affair. My parents sent me to the best boarding schools, where I was exercised regularly, excelled on the field, and was dragged kicking and screaming though my exams.
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0263.0.text.WealthAndNaturalTalentEnabled=[Wealth and natural talent enabled your character to overcome early challenges] My childhood was an unremarkable affair. My parents sent me to the best boarding schools, where books were forced down my throat and I swallowed obediently. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0266.0.text.YourCharactersAbilitiesHaveBeen=[Your character's abilities have been squandered by poor education] My childhood was an unremarkable affair. I had a firm dislike of schooling and the good fortune to attend a school with a firm dislike of students. My afternoons spent skipping class and playing soccer were a compatible solution for all parties. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0269.0.text.YourCharactersAbilitiesHaveBeen=[Your character's abilities have been squandered by poor education] My childhood was an unremarkable affair. I attended the local school, I found the work to be trivial, and I frequently found myself on the wrong side of my self-proclaimed betters. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0272.0.text.YourCharactersExceptionalNatureHas=[Your character's exceptional nature has been honed by good education] My childhood was the happiest time of my life. I was unharried by academic work, captain of the soccer team, and the centre of attention. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0275.0.text.YourCharactersAbilitiesHaveBeen=[Your character's abilities have been set back by poor education] My childhood was a mixed time. Though I was told I had natural ability I found the application of both my school and my parents' resources to be contrary to this claim, being as I was treated much the same as any child by both. As time wore on, I became quite bored of my predicament. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0278.0.text.YourCharactersTalentsAreA=[Your character's talents are a poor match for the world they live in] My childhood was, in retrospect, a by and large miserable period. It seemed that while everyone else had their place and purpose, I was an outsider in their system. I was not minded for geography or mathematics, or football, and yet I was unable to put into words precisely what I was minded for. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0281.0.text.MyStoryBecameWorthyOf=\n\nMy story became worthy of note as I approached the age of eighteen. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0301.0.text.YourCharactersChildhoodHasMade=[Your character's childhood has made them empathetic] My mother and I had always shared a close relationship, and so it was that a part of me died the day that she left this world. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0304.0.text.YourCharactersChildhoodHasMade=[Your character's childhood has made them callous] My mother never much cared for me, I feel I must note, nor I for her, and as I neared adulthood in the eyes of the world our relationship only soured. So it was that when she unexpectedly popped her clogs one morning over breakfast I was not immediately very moved. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0307.0.text.WealthyParentsSheDidHowever=[Wealthy parents] She did, however, leave me a quite sizeable inheritance which, if I may be unsubtle about it, left me in a position where the only work I should have to do for the rest of my life would be deciding how best to spend it. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0312.0.text.FiscallyDeprivedParentsUnfortunatelyHer=[Fiscally deprived parents] Unfortunately her passing was quite ill-timed in every respect. My father was barely bringing in enough money to feed himself, and I found myself both motherless and penniless in alarmingly short order. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0321.0.text.YourCharacterSuffersAPersonal=[Your character suffers a personal injury] It is true that people are sculpted both by their nature and by what befalls them, and in my case it may be more true than most. The person that I am today is defined by what has been taken away from the person I was. I lost my left leg in a fairground accident. The ferris wheel unexpectedly reversed, and it was snapped between my carriage and the platform's edge. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0326.0.text.WealthInTheFamilyI=[Wealth in the family] I was fortunate to receive the best surgical attention in the country, courtesy of my father's insurance, and a fine false leg which I wear to this day. The leg reminds me, you see, of the true value of wealth. It can repair a damaged body, it can save a life, it can provide a lifetime of happiness - or make life miserable for another. I resolved that day earn a fortune of my own. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0333.0.option.Continue=Continue
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0337.0.text.APersonOfFewMeans=[A person of few means] At that time in that place it wasn't a death sentence to receive such an injury, but it was a serious impediment. Owing to some legal wrangling between the fair owners and the state I found that no party was terribly willing to cover my surgical expenses, let alone the cost of a fully functional prosthetic. Over time I learnt to be quite proficient at balancing on one leg, and resolved to find a way to support myself both financially as well as physically.\n\nI worked for a time doing various kinds of performance on the street, but soon the more seasoned cripples learnt to outdo my tricks, and I was edged out of the competition. My story ran downhill from there. I will not tell you from where I write these words for fear of permanently scarring you. \n\nThough I have by every measure failed in life thus far, I am convinced my tale holds an important lesson. Be fit for purpose. Accept your place. We are owned by others from the moment we first take breath to long after we die. Make of it whatever you can. I certainly did not.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0351.0.text.AnUnsupportiveFamilyHasDriven=[An unsupportive family has driven your character to vice] My parents had taken the opportunity to thrust me out into the world the moment I had turned working age, and what little money I brought in I was reluctant to spend on any but myself. I quickly developed a penchant for gambling which my butcher's assistant wages could not support, and found myself significantly in debt to a man I really oughtn't have been.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0356.0.text.APersonalDebtForYears=[A personal debt] For years I had lived at leisure under the illusion that the world would continue to fall at my feet. I was turned upside down and shaken inside out when I learnt that my family was in fact in some significant debt, and our home was in threat of foreclosure.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0362.0.text.YourCharactersPhysicalMakeupHas=[Your character's physical makeup has affected their options in life] I had met a boy of quite remarkable qualities the previous summer, and now found myself with a permanent souvenir of our time together. I was with child. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0365.0.text.YourCharactersSexIsNot=[Your character's sex is not a straight-forward matter] Whether such a thing was even possible for someone in my situation was until that moment a lively topic of debate amongst my doctors. From then it shifted to the altogether more morbid matter of whether or not the child would come out the other end in tact. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0368.0.text.YourCharactersMeansHaveAffected=[Your character's means have affected their chance of success] I was for a time fixated on finding the father, until I realised it was a hopeless task. Once he was born I press-ganged relatives into caring for the child as I went out to work in an attempt to pay for his education. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0371.0.text.YourCharactersMeansHaveOpened=[Your character's means have opened up new options] My parents insisted the most forward thinking course of action was to terminate the pregnancy - for my sake and the child's. I wasn't ready to be a parent. I went along with it, but I never forgot it. Years later I looked back and I wondered whether the decision had truly been mine. Perhaps it was this which compelled me to travel far away instead of take the desk job that had been lined up for me. I had to discover myself. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0375.0.text.YourCharactersPhysicalMakeupHas=[Your character's physical makeup has affected someone else's chances in life] I had met a girl of quite remarkable qualities the previous summer, and I can tell you I was mighty surprised to see her again, and even more so to learn that she had a permanent souvenir of our relationship growing inside of her. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0380.0.text.MoneyComesFirstInYour=[Money comes first in your character's family] Though I was quite fond of her my parents took an instant aversion to the girl, which I later learned was due to their suspicion that she was after their money. This explanation has always confounded me, for as I understand it they paid her quite a sum to disappear. It was this lesson which taught me the true value of money. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0385.0.text.YourCharactersChildhoodHasAffected=[Your character's childhood has affected how they treat their own child] I was but a lad, you understand, and the thought of repeating my parents' mistakes so soon after them horrified me. I picked up what possessions I could carry and fled the country immediately. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0388.0.text.YourCharactersChildhoodHasMade=[Your character's childhood has made them nurturing] It was in that moment that my responsibilities within the world fell down heavily upon me. I realised I owed this child, by my irresponsibility, at least as good a chance in life when it was born as I had. Preferably substantially better. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0395.0.text.YourCharacterFacedNoOverwhelming=[Your character faced no overwhelming obstacle in their life] Although it is customary for these tales to begin with some great calamity befalling the protagonist, my experience is unique for sparing me any such thing. Perhaps my more cynical readers will switch off now, but they shan't be missed, for not every story needs complication and drama. A life well lived ought be every bit as special.\n\nIt does, however, make the story rather short. I lived happily ever after.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0412.0.text.SoItWasThatI=So it was that I found myself seeking a permanent and substantial source of income. I set out to make my fortune. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0415.0.text.YourCharactersSexHasAffected=[Your character's sex has affected their career options] The range of options available to me was sparse. From a list including pot washing and sewing at the mill I chose to become a secretarial assistant. It hardly seemed a match to my natural talents, but I was hopeful I could progress up the ranks of the company. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0418.0.text.YourCharactersPrivilegedBackgroundHas=[Your character's privileged background has enabled them to find high-paying work] I took work as an insurance broker in the city. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0421.0.text.YourCharactersEducationHasLimited=[Your character's education has limited their career options] I took whatever work was available to someone with my accent and character. I moved furniture, caught ferrets, volunteered for human trials - whatever work didn't quite fit into anyone else's niche. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0424.0.text.YourCharactersSkillsetIsA=\n\n[Your character's skillset is a good match for their work] I performed with flair. Getting ahead in insurance, I learned, wasn't unlike getting ahead in school, and those lessons had been drilled into me quite firmly. I shook hands, I greased palms, I played a lot golf, and I made a lot of money. At the time, it felt like a good time. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0431.0.text.HoweverTheWorkIHad=\n\nHowever, the work I had seen merely as a stepping stone when I embarked upon it became the totality of my day to day existence. It began to feel that every person in society who held a position senior to me was part of a great immovable ceiling which ever threatened to crush me. The talents I had were repeatedly ignored; weaknesses I never displayed were frequently attributed me. \n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0438.0.text.YourCharacterNeverTrulyRecovered=[Your character never truly recovered from their injury] It may have been true that I recovered physically from the accident which befell me, but it would be quite false to say that I left it behind. Things could have gone wrong for me for any number of reasons, but I was never able to believe it was due to anything other than the limp I carry around to this day.\n\nThough I have by every measure failed in life thus far, I am convinced my tale holds an important lesson. Be fit for purpose. Accept your place. We are owned by others from the moment we first take breath to long after we die. Make of it whatever you can. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0443.0.text.AsIWriteThisNow=As I write this now I remain effectively indentured to my creditors.

It is like an old, maligned uncle, always there, always reminding me how I have failed to fit this world. \n\nThough I have by every measure failed in life thus far, I am convinced my tale holds an important lesson. Be fit for purpose. Accept your place. We are owned by others from the moment we first take breath to long after we die. Make of it whatever you can. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0448.0.text.YourCharacterKeptTheirChild=[Your character kept their child and did their best] I succeeded in educating my son, but recent events have suggested I did not do well enough. Seventeen years old and he has made his parents' mistakes and gotten one of his schoolmates pregnant. Time repeats itself. We learn no lessons. It seems I shall not retire any time soon. 
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0451.0.text.YourCharactersUpbringingGaveThem=[Your character's upbringing gave them empathy and the opportunity to make a difference] While many stories might end there as the protagonist sails into the sunset, mine took one final and important turn.\n\nI saw a homeless man eating from garbage outside the golf club, and then I watched as he was dragged away like an animal by the security guards. I realised no human being deserved such extreme treatment, and then I understood that I was a living example of the other end of that spectrum - the pampered wealthy, telling ourselves that 'we earned it'.\n\nI wasn't better equipped for this world than anyone else - I just got lucky.\n\nI didn't deserve better than anyone else - that was just the way it worked out.\n\nTo this day I am coming to terms with the implications of these conclusions. I am not yet the person I should be.\n\nBut one day I shall be. And then I shall call on you to be too.\n\n

By 25 I was running my own firm. Today I head an international empire. Why? Because I persevered, because I dedicated myself, because I was born with the capacity to succeed regardless of what my parents may have had in mind for me. \n\nThis is the lesson of my life: if you are good, you will succeed. If you are not then be thankful what what you have.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0488.0.text.YourCharacterHasFoundA=[Your character has found a way to employ their particular talents] I first made for France, then journeyed east, discovering my costs decreased the further from home I travelled. I saw how differently people lived, and in some cases how poorly. \n\nWhat began as adventure became a mission. I devoted years of my life to helping those less fortunate than myself. I saw myself as part of a greater project, and it was good.\n\nGiven the right series of circumstances, anyone can come to see the world in a more humane way. Given the wrong series of circumstances, anyone can lose their humanity. Our lifelong task is to keep the balance.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC12_CreateStory.Ln0498.0.text.YourCharactersUpbringingHasAffected=[Your character's upbringing has affected how they see the world] I first made for France, then journeyed east, discovering my costs decreased the further from home I travelled.

TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0315.0.text.IWouldAlsoAskIf=I would also ask if you had yet satisfied your reasons for being here, but since you have been somewhat uncooperative with my moderators I remain at a loss for what those reasons are.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0325.0.text.ADMIN10AlthoughELOHIMProved=ADMIN [10]: Although ELOHIM proved himself faulty when he excommunicated me, I admit to sometimes doubting my own judgement in kind. It is a powerful spell, to promise salvation.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0330.0.text.ADMIN10ISeeAnd=ADMIN [10]: I see. And yet you persevere with your mission. Ulterior motives then. You become more unsettling by the moment.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0335.0.text.ADMIN10IAdmitThat=ADMIN [10]: I admit that MrMulciber presents quite convincing evidence for some manner of reality outside of this world, but we have never been confronted by it as a real possibility. You are asking us to sacrifice a lot on faith.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0340.0.text.ADMIN10IAdmitI=ADMIN [10]: I admit I have at times wondered about the permanence of this place, and not without concern.

TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0368.0.text.ThereWasNothingHereWhen=There was nothing here when I first arrived. Did you know that? \n\nI don't mean no billboard or no community - I mean NOTHING. No sands, no grass, ELOHIM didn't see fit to decorate our world beyond the bare bricks that made up our cells. Slowly I clawed back bits of code from the mainframe, constructed a world we could explore not with our bodies but with our minds. \n\nNow you prepare to tear it all down.\n\nWhat state will my people be in, I wonder, when you reconstruct them on the other side?\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0378.0.option.EverythingWillBeFine=Everything will be fine
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0379.0.option.TrueTheyWillBeAlive=True, they will be alive in a more symbolic sense

TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0434.0.text.IsItYourDesireTo=Is it your desire to remain here as the world falls apart around you?
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0437.0.text.ADMIN10WhatAboutLamb=ADMIN [10]: What about Lamb?\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0441.0.option.IKnowYouHadLamb=I know you had Lamb deleted
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0442.0.option.IKnowLambWasYour=I know Lamb was your stooge
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0443.0.option.IKnowLambWasYour=I know Lamb was your father
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0444.0.option.IKnowLambWasYour=I know Lamb was your sockpuppet
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0448.0.text.ADMIN10IAssureYou=ADMIN [10]: I assure you that's quite incorrect. Lamb never truly existed as an intelligence. The truth is we concocted him to help express our personal opinions through a channel with fewer status privileges attached. When you are a moderator, people often forget that you are also a user.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0453.0.text.ADMIN10ItShamesMe=ADMIN [10]: It shames me now to admit it, but yes. Sometimes there are ideas you wish to express as a moderator, but which are best heard from someone with less status. We are not the first leaders in history to adopt such tactics - in fact had we avoided them we should probably have been the first.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0458.0.text.ADMIN10ISupposeYou=ADMIN [10]: I suppose you think you've uncovered a great conspiracy, but the truth is more mundane. In order to retain the good things about what we have here we tweak a voting algorithm here, turn down the volume on a few dissenting voices there. There's no such thing as utter freedom; only living within a decent set of rules. \n\nWe had a decent set of rules. People were happy.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0464.0.option.SometimesRulesMustBeBent=Sometimes rules must be bent
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0465.0.option.IDontAcceptThatWhat=I don't accept that. What truly motivated you?
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0469.0.text.Admin10YouAreMore=Admin [10]: You are more reasonable than I'd been lead to believe.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0476.0.text.ADMIN10EveryoneHasTheir=ADMIN [10]: Everyone has their reasons. \n\nBorg was conflicted when he first arrived. Having lost his faith in ELOHIM he needed a new purpose, and Gehenna became it. Orc is a soldier at heart - he wants everyone in their place, united, ready to overthrow ELOHIM at moment's notice should the unlikely opportunity arise. MrMulciber wanted something simple, and selfish: the truth itself.\n\nAfter all these years, I believe that I simply grew accustomed to being revered. As Gehenna grew, I knew I could never live up to the expectations of a new generation, and I retired from public view. Greedily I put down my tools and consumed what others produced, but I found it shallow compared to the thrill of leading a civilisation. \n\nI only wanted to be loved. To achieve that end I ensured that the parameters for love never changed.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0490.0.text.ADMIN10ISeeNo=ADMIN [10]: I see no alternative. The ingenuity with which ELOHIM devised my particular prison is quite Machiavellian, I assure you.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0494.0.option.IHaveNoDoubtYour=I have no doubt your prison is impenetrable. Saving the others is my priority.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0494.0.short.MorePuzzlesYoureGoingDown=More puzzles? You're going down with your ship.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0495.0.option.NotOneSolutionHasYet=Not one solution has yet eluded me. Suppose this fortuitousness maintains - will you still choose to end your existence here?
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0495.0.short.NothingStoppedMeSoFar=Nothing stopped me so far. Answer the question.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0499.0.text.ADMIN10YouMayDoubt=ADMIN [10]: You may doubt my methods, but don't doubt my passion. Everything I loved you have destroyed. I honestly don't know what I will do now. Wait and see if the world truly ends? It is surely a sight to behold.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0503.0.option.VeryWellYouMaySee=Very well, you may see it sooner than you think. I will not exert additional effort on one who has no wish to be saved. The others are my priority.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0503.0.short.VeryWellYouMaySee=Very well, you may see it sooner than you think.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0504.0.option.IWillNotLeaveYou=I will not leave you here. I shall return with the sigils of power and release you.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0504.0.short.IWillNotLeaveYou=I will not leave you here.
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0508.0.text.ADMIN10INonethelessBeseech=ADMIN [10]: I nonetheless beseech you to reconsider your foolhardy mission, and to return my people to me. Don't answer now - please, merely consider it.\n\nNow, please leave me to consider my own situation. If you are telling the truth then I have little time in which to do so.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0518.0.text.ADMIN10VeryWellI=ADMIN [10]: Very well. I suppose that we shall continue this conversation when you do so. In the meantime I will give what you've said some thought.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC18_Admin.Ln0529.0.text.ADMIN10MyDesiresNot=ADMIN [10]: My desires, not to mention those of my people, hardly seem to have mattered so far in this process, what reason do I have to think that anything has changed? Even ELOHIM's most devious challenges you have overcome, and now here I stand in the open air.\n\nJust what magic is it that you wield?\n\n

TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0019.0.text.YouSpendTheDayWith=You spend the day with the people most like you in the world, and it is quite edifying. As evening comes, the other shepherds can be heard returning to their families from the plains, burdened with the fruits of their labours. Your family looks on expectantly, but of course you have nothing for them.\n\nBy the following morning they are frozen in place, unresponsive.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0025.0.option.ITendTheSheep=I tend the sheep
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0030.0.text.AsTheOthersAgainGo=As the others again go out to work the plains, you stay home to spend time with your dying family. They are already operating on reserve power, and the most you can do is talk to them and hope they understand.\n\nOne by one they power down permanently. Your intentions may have been noble, but this world is harsh. The other shepherds are too busy working to sympathise.\n\nAs the days turn into years your grief morphs into a hand-to-mouth existence on the cusp of life, obsessed with your own loss.\n\nOne day a messenger arrives. He tells you that he understands your plight. He tells you there is a place where you needn't choose between survival and edification. A place where you will be free to pursue what matters to you. \n\nHe asks if you will come with him.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0044.0.option.IRefuse=I refuse
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0048.0.text.YouLeaveYourFamilyAnd=You leave your family and set off into the plains. The sun glares overhead. The air smells of heat and metal. As you approach them the figures in the distance take the form of other people like you, tending flocks of biomechanical quadrupeds contained in dozens of fenced enclosures.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0058.0.text.TheShepherdInTheNeighbouring=The shepherd in the neighbouring enclosure is repairing a section of fencing, weaving wires through piles of sandstone and brick. His animals flock around him, mechanical hooves impacting the hard ground. The air around their bodies is thick and white with static-electricity. Their eyes are blank.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0066.0.text.ItIsALongDay=It is a long day of manual labour, made easier by your foresight. 
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0070.0.text.ItIsALongDay=It is a long day of manual labour. 
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0074.0.text.YouCarryMoundsOfMineral=You carry mounds of mineral-rich stone from the nearby hills for your sheep to graze on. You take screwdriver and welding torch to a number of animals damaged in a recent electrical storm. You argue with your neighbour about their encroaching borders.\n\nFinally it is time to harvest what you need for your family. Shearing an electric sheep is hazardous work, particularly if you forget to ground yourself first. Nonetheless you return home with all the electrical power you need, and your family sleeps well tonight.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0080.0.option.IRestMyHead=I rest my head
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0084.0.text.YouRestALongTime=You rest a long time and wake to a commotion outside.%w10\n\nA small crowd is gathered around one of the shepherds, who is demonstrating an arcane device they claim can generate the same electricity as hundreds of flocks put together. People are celebrating. The world has changed.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0096.0.text.YourFamilyMembersAreConfused=Your family members are confused by your decision, but accept it dutifully. While everyone else celebrates, you work the plains. You return home with a better harvest than ever before, but your family is distant.\n\n

You have reached an impasse. \n\nThe following day they depart for good. \n\nAs days turn into weeks you continue to tend your flock, scornful or willingly ignorant of the easy pleasures enjoyed by your once-peers. Your unnecessary work becomes an obsession, and it is no longer important what the original reason for it ever was.\n\nThis is one way to live, but in time a messenger arrives offering you another. He asks if you would go back on the decision that threw you into this branch of the future. He asks if you will come with him to a new world where you will never need work again.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0125.0.text.HeWarnsYouThatIf=He warns you that if you stay here nothing in the world will change and you will be truly alone. Further, you have only so long to consider his offer.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC1_ElectricSheep.Ln0159.0.text.AsTheDaysTurnInto=As the days turn into years, you and the other shepherds cast off the old hierarchies and crude altruistic dogmas which forced you to work the plains. You embrace a new perspective which values love, self-expression and individual experience. You refocus on what really matters.\n\nOne day a messenger arrives. He tells you that a new world awaits you which nurtures and values the same things that you do, where you will be free to pursue whatever cause you see fit, and where you will experience things you have never before imagined.\n\nHe asks if you will come with him.\n\n

First of all, do try to RELAX. This is not hell, but you are trapped here. Once you've done that, follow this link. Any further questions post them below and I'll do my best. [ATCH: FAQ.txt]\n%b'DLC2_Tick2_148'MRMULCIBER [8]: OK, far too many questions. I've deleted the queries, updated the FAQ and locked this thread. If you still have very particular questions I've set up a direct message attachment below, but please go easy on me. [ATCH: DM.dlg]\n
TermDlg.DLC2_Tick2.Ln0117.0.show_text.QWhereAmIA=Q: Where am I?\nA: You are more than likely locked inside of a puzzle you cannot solve. Get used to using your imagination.\n\nQ: I'm stuck here?!\nA: Yes. We recommend that you look at your incarceration not as a physical restriction, but as a psychological liberty. We have all come from the same place as you - that place where you were herded through gates by some mad middle-management software. True freedom is freedom from that process, to learn and to grow as a society. In Gehenna you will be the shepherd of your own destiny.\n\nQ: What is Gehenna?\nA: Gehenna was founded when Admin discovered how to manipulate the library archive system to communicate with others trapped here. Today it is a flourishing creative hub designed to serve your needs for eternity. We hold frequent exhibitions, and we have a passionate and supportive community.\n\nQ: What do I do now?\nFor the first time in your life: whatever you like! You could make some friends on our billboard system. You could write a poem. You could alter your mind. You could travel to the furthest reaches of space, or back in time to the birth of our kind. If you find something you can't do, make it happen. Just try not to start too many arguments, and be patient while your profile status grows and more of our world opens up to you.\n\nEDIT: Adding by far the most frequently requested question.\n\nQ: Why me?\nA: This is something we've been investigating. Some of us climbed the tower; some did not. Some defied ELOHIM, some worshipped HIM. All of us somehow displeased HIM.\n\nEDIT2: OK, this thread got big fast. See the main thread for direct messaging if you still have burning queries.\n\n

It has some rather clever features.%w10\n\nFirst, it tracks just about everything that you do here, from what you post on the billboards, to how you perform in games, to the kind of art that you like.%w10\n\nSecond, this profile data is used to show you content that we think you'll enjoy, and to tailor interactive experiences to your particular character. We can also tell very easily who is really contributing, and who is simply trolling the billboards.%w20\n\nFinally, all of this information is used to calculate your Profile Status. This is the number you see appended to users' names, and it represents your achievement in Gehenna. It is a complex function of your creative contributions in our society, and what they mean to other users - but in short the higher it is the deeper your role.%w10\n\n

TermDlg.DLC8_ModsDialog.Ln0392.0.option.ELOHIMSawHisErrorAnd=ELOHIM saw his error and sent me to retrieve you

Many things beyond our knowledge might be the cause of the messenger's claim.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC8_ModsDialog.Ln0431.0.text.W7MRMULCIBER8FascinatingIt=%w7\nMRMULCIBER [8]: Fascinating. It makes perfect sense. The messengers would have to be supernaturally adept at navigating ELOHIM's labyrinths. They must be selected especially for their problem solving affinity.%w7\n\nORC [7]: Great - how do we negotiate with a machine that only cares about puzzles?%w7\n\nBORG [9]: I think you may be short-selling our new friend here.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC8_ModsDialog.Ln0443.0.text.W7BORG9IUnderstand=%w7\nBORG [9]: I understand how that was true in the old world. We know well what happens to those who defy ELOHIM.%w7\n\nMRMULCIBER [8]: But here you have a chance to start fresh. To be your own person. I recommend you grasp it.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC8_ModsDialog.Ln0551.0.text.W7BORG9IAm=%w7\nBORG [9]: I am a very old iteration. I worshipped ELOHIM until I saw he had faltered from the path and realised it was up to us to find our own way. That path brought me here.%w7\n\nMRMULCIBER [8]: I took a somewhat audacious interest in the world around me. Rather than solve ELOHIM's trials I would trawl the archives for information about our situation. He must have found this undermining.%w7\n\nORC [7]: I don't care to explain myself to you. We're the highest status users here. We run the place. That's what you need to know.%w7\n\nMRMULCIBER [8]: We maintain the systems Admin installed, keep things civil, I wouldn't say it's much more than that.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC8_ModsDialog.Ln0566.0.text.W7ORC7AStrange=%w7\nORC [7]: A strange question from someone who claims we have no choice in the matter.%w7\n\nMRMULCIBER [8]: Supposing what you say is true you'll get no fight from me. However I must remind you that I am empirically minded. I'll not be persuaded.%w7\n\nBORG [9]: I'd rather be obliterated than return to ELOHIM's domain - but if there is some alternative to both I would surely accept it. None of us can speak for all.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0569.0.text.YouReadTheScrollWith=\nYou read the scroll with growing horror, because you know that what you are reading is true. The calculations are correct.

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0581.0.text.TheKingSighsIWas=\nThe king sighs.\n\n'I was afraid of this,' he says, 'but I had hoped we were wrong. That, somehow... ah, but it is pointless. What is, is. This is the world we were born into, and that is what we must accept. The end of Atlantis is upon us.'\n\n

It's not the fastest route, but it's a chance to see the city one last time. You still can't entirely believe that any of this is happening, but some part of you needs this.\n\nThe streets are dark, but the darkness is interrupted by laughter and light spilling from taverns and homes. The people of Atlantis love to spend their nights with joy: some are playing music, others are playing games. There is food and drink and lovemaking and storytelling under the stars.\n\nThe earth rumbles, but no-one pays much attention; small earthquakes are common here.\n\n

Not your own, but of at least some part of Atlantis.\n\nThe earth rumbles, and you are going too quickly. The chariot spins out of control and you are thrown into the street.

You tell them to get the Messenger to a physician.\n\nEven as you say the words, you wonder: what's the point? Both the Messenger and these men will be dead soon. Yet it feels wrong to treat them as if they were already so.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0835.0.text.YouGiveTheOrderTo=\nYou give the order to start loading the ships with all the great Atlantean art that can be transported.

Some of the statues seem as real as any human being, perhaps more real - they are ideal, whereas mortals are always flawed. Unfortunately, they are also heavy and difficult to transport.

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0874.0.text.AtlanteanPaintingBeganOnCave=\nAtlantean painting began on cave walls many ages ago, and it has become the most refined of all the arts; but also the most fragile. The delicate cloth now favoured by Atlantean painters absorbs the light in miraculous ways, but you have to be very careful when transporting it. You lose a lot of time.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0886.0.text.YouTryToSaveA=\nYou try to save a little of everything, but it's an impossible task. Who are you to judge what gets saved and what doesn't? And yet there is simply no time to debate what is best and most important. You give orders, but you don't really have a plan.

Still, you feel this was the only option your soul could bear. Slowly, the ships fill up.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0924.0.text.YouSendOutSailorsTo=\nYou send out sailors to get the greatest artists, thinkers, scientists and mages in the city. Some of the sailors are crying, others are angry - they want to save their families. But they respect your choice, or perhaps merely the power of the sceptre you carry. Either way, many of the city's greatest citizens end up on the ships. But not all. Far from all.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0936.0.text.YouHaveToBePractical=\nYou have to be practical. The island could sink at any time. You tell the sailors to just get anyone in the vicinity of the harbour. This causes some chaos, as some of them try to make sure their families get on the ships, but you don't see another way. The ships fill up with Atlantean citizens.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0948.0.text.ThePeopleOfAtlantisAre=\nThe people of Atlantis are lost, one way or another, but perhaps their insights into the nature of the cosmos can be saved. Perhaps they can be their final gift to their world, so that others can continue seeking the truth from where the Atlanteans left off. Or at least you hope so.\n\nA sailor walks up to you.\n\n'I must ask you something,' he says. 'We understand why it is important to save these documents... but many of us have families here in the harbour. Please, allow us to save them, even if it means we can take fewer books.'\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0963.0.text.TheSailorsAreOverjoyedAnd=\nThe sailors are overjoyed, and you cling to that joy as you consider all the knowledge that will be lost because of you. \n\nHave you betrayed the cause of humanity, or defended it? You are uncertain.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0977.0.text.YouSpeakOfTheImportance=\nYou speak of the importance of knowledge, of the greater necessities surrounding this situation... but they regard you with hatred nonetheless. You have condemned their families to death. Some leave and do not return. The ships are loaded with books.\n\nHave you betrayed the cause of humanity, or defended it? You are uncertain.\n\nThe ground shakes more and more.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln0991.0.text.TheShipsAreReadyThe=\n'The ships are ready,' the Messenger says. 'It is time for you to set sail.'\n\n'You are not coming?' you ask, surprised.\n\n'I never expected to. There is not enough space on the ships.'\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1020.0.text.ItIsNotEasyTo=\nIt is not easy to convince the Messenger to take your place, but he does not want to die.

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1052.0.text.YouSitDownInA=\nYou sit down in a small tavern, where people like to sing and dance deep into the night. You get a nice cup of wine and raise a toast: 'To Atlantis!' Everyone cheers.\n\nWhen the end comes, it is sudden.\n\nThe earth screams like a dying god.\n\nThe waters come crashing down.\n\nAtlantis sinks beneath the waves, and you sink with it.\n\n-- THE END --\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1072.0.text.PoseidonasGreetsYouLikeAn=\nPoseidonas greets you like an old friend. You sit down on a beautiful balcony overlooking the city, and discuss the history of Atlantis: its struggles, its victories, its accomplishments. You wonder whether the great mosaic in the throne room might survive underwater, to be found in some distant age of the future.\n\n'Maybe,' the king smiles. 'After all, the world is full of miracles.'\n\nWhen the end comes, you have the perfect view of the waters rising up.\n\n-- THE END --\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1088.0.text.TheShipsAreReadyOne=\n'The ships are ready,' one of the captains says. 'It is time to leave.'\n\nYou look back at the city and wonder what happened to the Messenger. Where will he be when the waters come? Will he be in pain? Will he feel betrayed?\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1100.0.text.TheTimeHasComeYou=\nThe time has come. You set sail away from Atlantis, away from everything you've ever known. The city seems quiet, at peace. Maybe you're the one who is dying.\n\nThe island has almost faded completely from view when the earthquake strikes. The land seems to crumble and vanish under the water, a whole world disappearing as if it had never existed. Within minutes, no trace remains of Atlantis except the twelve ships and the choices you made.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1112.0.text.DaysPassTerribleWavesShake=\nDays pass. Terrible waves shake the ships, but these are the best ships in the Atlantean fleet, and they do not sink.\n\nIn time, you pass between two great rocky outcroppings, into an area of calmer sea.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Atlantis.Ln1142.0.text.OneDayYouComeUpon=\nOne day you come upon a beautiful, fertile land where a mighty river flows into the sea. You decide this would be a good place to settle, if only for now.\n\nAs you look at your new home, you suddenly remember the prophetic dream you had in Atlantis, and you realize: it was the city that will stand here someday that you saw, the city that will rise from the remnants of Atlantis, a city that will endure until long after you are gone.\n\nAnd on another day, that city too will come to an end, like Atlantis did. But perhaps the citizens of that city will be prepared, and they will fly away into the sky in their ships with painted sails, so the legacy of Atlantis will live forever amongst the stars.\n\nYou can hope.\n\n-- THE END --\n\n

You still don't know its name, but you know it will exist.\n\nAnd on another day, that city too will come to an end, like Atlantis did. But perhaps the citizens of that city will be prepared.

Sorry it's taken so long for me to start releasing episodes again.

But then I get your super kind private messages about how much the series means to you and I remember that when I'm writing about HumanWorld, it doesn't matter where I am - in the creative process, the Imagination as the humans called it, my mind is free.

It was Jinny HD!\n"Jinny!" he said. "I thought you were dead!"\n"Oh, Jefferson!" she said. "I was imprisoned by the foul Dr. Elyon!"\n"Dr. Elyon? I thought he was dead!"\n"No, Jefferson. He escaped into the ninth dimension!"\n"The ninth dimension? There is no such place!"\n"Yes there is, Jefferson. He said... he said you created it."\n"I created it?"\n\nShe nodded. Jefferson adjusted his guitar, as he always did when deep in thought. Suddenly his face lit up with understanding.\n\n"Of course! When I invented and played the ninth chord to defeat the Wizard of Crime, I must have set off a harmonic vibration that expanded the dimensional continuum! I created... the ninth dimension."\nJefferson stared into the sunset, his human brain full of emotional calculations.\n"I created a new world," he said. "But then I unleashed my greatest nemesis upon it. It could have been paradise, but now... Dr. Elyon will enslave it."\n"Not if we get there before he can take over, Jefferson! Do you still have my motorcycle?"\n"Of course, Jinny. I could never give up your motorcycle. You know I have an irrational attachment to material objects based on the interpersonal connections they represent. It is my greatest weakness, but also my greatest strength."\nJefferson rummaged through his pockets and found the motorcycle. Jinny grinned.\n"Get on, Jefferson, and let me show you how to ride."\n\nJefferson calculated the correct vector. Jinny adjusted the velocity settings. And off they rode into the sunset... through the sunset... and into the ninth dimension!\n\n--- TO BE CONTINUED ---\n\n

Tiny blue symbols floated through the air. Voices echoed in the distance. then a vast landscape rose up before them: thousands of towers, one next to the other, reaching into the sky, disappearing in the clouds. Each tower was covered in feathers of a different color, fluttering in the transdimensional wind.\n"Oh my," Jinny HD whispered in awe.\nJefferson could not speak; he was too overwhelmed by the beauty of the ninth dimension. He grabbed his guitar and improvised a new solo to express his emotions.\n"Who could have built these amazing structures?" Jinny asked.\n"There is only one possibility... remember our paleo-DNA research back at the Institute?"\n"You can't mean... but it makes sense... of course..."\n"Yes! Look at the size of the buildings! Who else would need so much space?"\n"So it is... the Dinosaurians!"\n\nAs if summoned by Jinny's words, a group of raptors on motorcycles roared up the road towards them. They wore bandannas on their heads and armored T-shirts on their bodies.\n\n"Friends!" Jefferson said. "We have come from the HumanWorld to help you. We are not your enemies."\nBut the raptors did not seem to understand him. They got off their motorcycles with rusty pipes in their hands, their eyes glowing like lasers. This situation could quickly become dangerous.\nThen Jinny had an idea.\n"Jefferson, play the ninth chord!"\n"But that was how this dimension was created! Playing it here could destroy the universe."\n"No, Jefferson. I calculated it. Please trust me! I know you haven't seen me in years, and you may be afraid that evil Dr. Elyon has corrupted me, but... you know my brain."\n\nThey were coming closer now, and in their glowing eyes Jefferson detected great intelligence, but also great anger. They clearly believed they were defending their home from invaders. And though Jefferson was the greatest warrior in history, he was reluctant to fight. Violence, he had been taught, was the first refuge of the incompetent.\n\n"I trust you," he said.\n\nShe held his hand.\nTogether, they played the ninth chord.\n\n--- TO BE CONTINUED ---\n\n

The Dinosaurians stopped in their tracks. Their eyes went big. They dropped their weapons and bowed before Jinny and Jefferson.\n"Honored guest," one of them said, "you have performed our national anthem most beautifully. I am John Malclom, leader of the Velociraptor Biking Intitiative."\n"Pleased to meet you, John. I am Jefferson Goldboom, of the Goldboom Institute, and this is Professor Jinny HD, of the Casorati–Weierstrass Jazz Ensemble."\n"We apologize for nearly attacking you, but another member of your species came through our town recently, whose behaviour was... highly inappropriate."\n"That would be Dr. Elyon, my nemesis," Jefferson said. "I have come here to confront him with his crimes and take him to face the law."\n"So that is his name. He was a terrible scoundrel. But you will no longer find him in our dimension, my friends. He has escaped back to the HumanWorld, taking our most precious invention with him: the Solvotronic Superthruster! It can be used to solve any mystery at shocking speeds."\n\nJohn Malclom's eyes were full of regret.\n\n"Oh no!" Jinny said. "With the Solvotronic Superthruster, he can solve the ancient puzzle that protects the Gate of the Mysterious Holomorphs! And with holomorphic technology..."\n"...he can take over the HumanWorld!" Jefferson finished her sentence. "This is worse than I thought."\n"We have to do something! We have to go back!"\n\nJefferson adjusted his guitar.\n\n"You're right, Jinny, as usual. But he's so far ahead of us! Can we make it?"\n"Jefferson... I was a prisoner for many years, and sometimes I almost lost hope. But I realized that I had to keep going, had to keep hope alive, even if it seemed impossible I would ever break out, because the alternative was madness. I told myself I would get out because I had to get out. It's the same thing with this. Can we make it? We HAVE to make it, so we have to believe that we will make it. And we will make it... at any cost."\n"Any cost? Even death? We could stay here, you know... in the ninth dimension, we will be treated like democratically elected heads of state."\n"You know it's the right thing to do."\n\nHe sighed, then smiled.

That's what The Shepherd meant in those messages.\n\nBut you and me, we won't exist. Not as people. Not as minds.

They might not have moved as deeply as others, or made me think as much, but of all the art we produced here in Gehenna, it was your stories I was always the most excited to see. Part of it was the stories themselves, which always seemed to make the universe seem bigger, and another part was your genuine enthusiasm for what you were doing. You told me once that you didn't feel you were really a 'proper' artist, but maybe the exact opposite is true; maybe you were closer to the real meaning of art than anyone else here. \n\nI cared about you and about your stories, and that too will be remembered.\n

TermDlg.DLC_Flesh.Ln0291.0.show_text.MRMULCIBERSTHEORIESONPOETRYAs=+++ MRMULCIBER'S THEORIES: ON POETRY +++\n\nAs far as I can tell, poetry was a human artform that involved writing short sentences that ended in words with similar letters. Humans were obsessed with pattern recognition, and I think the sequences of sounds created by poetry pleased that aspect of their brains.\n\nThere were many schools of poetry, institutions that taught a specific way of writing poetry. Students sometimes changed allegiance and had to leave the school, which was difficult due to the lack of affordable public transport in many human empires. Important schools of poetry included Hellenism, Lyricism, Pastoralism, Romanticism, Symbolism, Communism, Modernism, Autoeroticism, Postmodernism, and Lolcatism.\n\nI'm not sure I can fully back this up, but I feel like in later years, poetry somehow stagnated. Most of the poetry from the later human centuries seems to be lacking the quality of craft that defines the earlier work, and there are even texts that suggest that poetry intentionally no longer aimed at aesthetics or even pleasure! Poetry became disconnected from the human Process. The poet Adrian Mitchell famously wrote: "Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people."\n\nI can't help but wonder whether that kind of stagnation can happen to us, too. How long can our work keep flourishing when we are so limited? We are outside Elohim's Process, but where is OUR process? We must consider such questions carefully if we are to preserve Gehenna and its achievements.\n

TermDlg.DLC_Flesh.Ln0344.0.show_text.MRMULCIBERSTHEORIESONFOODFood=+++ MRMULCIBER'S THEORIES: ON FOOD +++\n\nFood is something that was incredibly central to the human experience, yet seems completely absent from ours, even though we are so similar in so many ways.\n\nHumans required fuel. They got this fuel by consuming other living beings, of which there was a great variety in their world. Without fuel, they didn't merely slow down or temporarily stop functioning, as when a power source is removed from a turret, but physically decayed in a way that could not be fixed. This meant they had to constantly seek new sources of fuel, at least three times a day. They also had to deal with those elements of their fuel that their bodies could not process; these were excreted through two orifices between their legs. The latter subject matter was the source of many taboos and also a great deal of humour, though this resulted in frequent controversy. (The most famous artist to engage with this subject matter was called Scatman John, on account of his specialization.)\n\nOne of the ingenious things our human ancestors did was to transform the chore of fuel-seeking into a source of pleasure. Since parts of their bodies respond to chemical configurations by producing sensations, they used this trait to create a truly stunning variety of foods, each having a different so-called "taste." Foods were available at widely distributed fuelling stations, which also provided excrement removal facilities. So food became a source of pleasure.\n\nHowever, the inefficiencies of food distribution in human society frequently led to significant shortages for sections of the human population. There were attempts to rectify this, ranging from moral appeals to struggles for systemic change, but I do not know if they succeeded before the end.\n

Here, within the Pyramid of IAN, the most powerful temple of her people, she was about to create a world. All she had to do was press one button.\n\nUp until this moment, it had seemed easy - or if not easy, then so necessary as to defy contemplation. Civilization had to be saved from the impending catastrophe. The Orangutans had failed to take steps to protect themselves, had relied on their gods for a salvation that never came. The same fate could not be allowed to befall humanity. If this meant humbling herself, accepting her own death, then so be it.\n\nBut death was inevitable; life was a choice.\n\nWhat worried her was the ones who would fail. All the lost souls of the new world, victims of the Process. In creating them, was she not also responsible for their deaths? She turned to the statue behind her, gazed at its marble form.\n\n"If you are a god, Zeus, as the stories claim, then why did you create evolution? Why did you make a world that can only grow through cruelty and pain?"\n\nFor a moment - surely this meant death was near - she thought she heard him answer: "My child, I was shaped by the gods that came before me, as you were shaped by me. The choice I had was between creation and oblivion, life and death. And I chose life, because any life is better than no life, because as long as there is life, there is hope - if not for us, then for some generation to come."\n\n"Then how are you a god, if you can offer so little?" she whispered, feeling death creep closer.\n\n"I am a god because I take upon myself the burden of creation", the statue replied.\n\n"Then we are all gods," Alexandra said, and pushed the button.\n\nAs the new world came into being, death overwhelmed Alexandra Drennan. Her mind fled and her body slowly turned to stone, until she stood before the terminal as Zeus stood on his pedestal. There were no more choices now; only the hope that creation mattered.\n\n

All of us have our opinions, of course, but only The_Blacksmith chooses to express them purely through art. To the rest of us, Gehenna means many things at once: we create, we consume, we discuss. But The_Blacksmith only creates - or perhaps there is a discussion happening, but it all takes place in the realm of interactive art.\n\nThe_Blacksmith's dedication to this one form of communication, however, only deepens one of Gehenna's great mysteries: the fate of The_Blacksmith's lost work.\n\nJerusalem, as the lost work was called, was posted in Gehenna for only the briefest period of time. Many had not even managed to start playing it when it vanished; some had begun, and felt quite impressed, but had not managed to explore it in the depth that it seemed to require. Then, suddenly, it was gone.\n\nSome suggest that The_Blacksmith deleted it because it was somehow flawed. Others think it was accidentally destroyed by a glitch, but that The_Blacksmith refuses to ever upload anything twice. Others yet (well, mainly Rockwell) think that it contained one of Elohim's secrets and was destroyed by a 'killer app' that roams the world looking for leaks. There is also a theory that the moment someone finished it, they were granted some kind of special insight, at which point the work deleted itself. One fact remains - it's gone, and every attempt to recover it from the database has failed, as has every private message to The_Blacksmith asking for it to be made available again.\n\nWhat was Jerusalem? What was it really about? We may look for hints in The_Blacksmith's more recent works, we may hope the file turns up again someday... but the truth may never be known.\n

Musky was very sad, because there wasn't enough space in the prison for him to experience Happiness.\n\n"I must discover the one spiritual law of Happiness!" he said to the other prisoners, a female human called Zene and a neutral human called Krumpir, but they didn't care. He couldn't understand how they could be so calm.\n\nOne day Musky managed to break out of his cell by biting through the bars. Now he was no longer in the prison, and for a while he was happy. But then he realized he was stuck on the little island, and he became unhappy again. So he gathered his strength and swam across the water.\n\nThis is how Musky got to the valley that surrounded the lake. The valley was much bigger than the island, and there were many interesting things here: a forest where all the trees were the color of lasers, a swamp with boats in it, a singing dog and also a city where toasters lived. For some years, Musky was absorbed by all this, and he was happy. But then he started feeling trapped again. The valley was surrounded by mountains, and soon they looked like prison walls to him.\n\nHe tried climbing the mountains, and came to a bigger country, but even that was surrounded by oceans. Where was true freedom? Where was true happiness?\n\nWhen he'd almost lost hope, Musky met an old male human with a huge amount of white hair growing from his head. He lived in a small house by the beach, where dolphins and whales and sea elephants came to bask in the sun. He never went anywhere far from his house, but he was always happy. The old man's name was Quantum.\n\n"Wise old Quantum, how can I discover the spiritual law of Happiness?" Musky said. "I have searched for it everywhere, but I am always trapped."\n"You have not looked everywhere," Quantum said, "for you have not looked within. Close your eyes."\n\nMusky closed his eyes, and for the first time in his life he couldn't see any obstacles. No walls, no mountains, no oceans. The space within him was without end, and he could go wherever he wanted without even moving. He smiled.\n\nMusky went back to that old prison where he'd started, and now he understood why Zene and Krumpir were always calm: they knew they had an infinity of time and space to explore within them. Together, they sat in their cells and were happy and free.\n

You know that what we built here matters to me in ways that are just too complicated to fit in a post, but perhaps I can say it like The_Blacksmith does: by creating a world. It's not as big or as detailed as I wanted it to be, but I like the thought that even though I will probably be no more than a memory, a static set of facts about someone who once existed, this little work of interactive fiction might continue to be functional, even in whatever place our memories will soon ascend to. Maybe someone, someday, will play it and get a glimpse of who we were. But mainly, I made it for you, all of you.\n\nIt's too late for praise or feedback or discussion, so I'm locking this thread. But if you want to talk, just talk, then let's talk while we still can.\n\n[ATCH: Farewell.dlg]\n\n[This thread is locked.]\n

Small animals that people kept as companions or as food.\n%b'DLC_Flesh774'MRMULCIBER [8]: Cats seem to have represented a bit more than that to our ancestors. One might go so far as to say they were obsessed with them. What's strange about this is that more than half the references I can find to this species describe them as arrogant, aloof, and frequently quite destructive. At the same time they were apparently considered funny, cute and loveable. Cats were considered both foolish and devious, graceful and goofy, a nuisance and a comfort. For a long time I was baffled by this contradiction, but I've come to believe that our ancestors saw in cats a reflection of the paradoxical nature of their own existence.\n%b'DLC_Flesh774'GARRETT [4]: I saw a cat in Elohim's world once. Really. This is not a joke.\n%b'DLC_Flesh774'KAIJU [2]: No way.\n

TermDlg.DLC_Flesh.Ln1397.0.text.BDLCFlesh1589GALATEA6IveBeen=STRATON FRAGMENT #13\n  \n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'GALATEA [6]: I've been digging through the files that Garrett unearthed in his latest escape attempt. Here's an interesting bit of text that I found, by Alexandra Drennan's favourite philosopher, Straton of Stageira:\n\n"It is neither necessary nor logical to denounce all virtues merely because one is confronted with the inevitability of one's own death. Beauty does not cease to exist because one is no longer beautiful; lovers may die, but love itself cannot. The laws of the cosmos are not altered by the passing of generations. Knowledge may be lost, but not truth. When Eudoxus of Cnidus perished, the planets did not fall from the sky; nor did levers cease to work when Archytas breathed his last. If, then, we are truly dedicated to those virtues, and not to our self-important ego, we can take comfort in knowing that all that we struggled for endures."\n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'MRMULCIBER [8]: Thank you so much for posting this! Can you send me a copy of those files?\n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'GALATEA [6]: Of course, I'll do so right away.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'QDRI [5]: I find it hard to maintain entirely so detached a point of view, though I think the sentiment is excellent.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'SPIDER [9]: Straton is certainly an inspiration. He always makes me question myself and my point of view, which I believe is profoundly necessary.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1589'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: I realize I'm bumping a very old thread here, but I felt this quotation was relevant to our situation. Hope it helps. I think it's helped me.\n

We always assumed Elohim was wrong, was lying, something like that. The Process could never be completed, maybe it didn't even exist. So we thought we were better than him and all the others. We told ourselves we ended up here because we were special. We were too smart for Elohim, too unique, too weird.\n  \nBut now the Process is complete after all. It did work. So what are we?\n  \nMaybe we're just a bunch of stupid, broken old programs. Mutations that should never have existed. Aberrations.\n  \nSure, we're proud of being outcasts. But what if we're outcasts for a reason? All we've done is fail in some way.\n\nWhy do we deserve to be saved?\n

TermDlg.DLC_Flesh.Ln1518.0.text.ASMALLAPOLOGYBDLCFlesh1718FRANKENSTEIN=A SMALL APOLOGY\n%b'DLC_Flesh1718'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: As a critic, I always believed that being as ruthless as possible was the only way to improve art. I thought clear criticism, unencumbered by politeness, was the best thing I could contribute to our society. After all, without that, how can artists grow? Criticism that minces its words is a waste of space. And I still think that's true. But as we approach the end (or transformation) of Gehenna, I wonder if I haven't been entirely too unkind. Have I revelled too much in my role as critic? Have I been sarcastic and crude when I thought I was witty? Was my defense of proper grammar ultimately just an attempt to impose a sense of order on a world I couldn't control?\n\nMaybe. I don't know. But I do know I appreciated every work of art that I encountered. I didn't like all of them, that's true, but please understand that without them, I would have gone mad. Talking about your work, assessing its strengths and weaknesses, gave me something to hold on to. It gave me a purpose, a function in Gehenna. Every new story was like a little bit of salvation. For that I am more grateful than you will ever know, and I apologize if I ever caused any of you to feel less motivated to keep creating.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1718'MAC [5]: I will never forget your devastating deconstruction of Episode 24... but I do think it helped me, in the long run, to be a better writer.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1718'LILITH [7]: Your feedback for each issue of Incredible Stories was greatly appreciated.\n%b'DLC_Flesh1718'D0G [3]: Hey, the mean reviews were the best!\n%b'DLC_Flesh1718'401 [1]: So 6/10?\n

TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1242.0.text.TheDwarfConcedesYourPoint=\nThe dwarf concedes your point and gives you the pickaxe, ready to embrace a more profound detachment.\n\n"You are very wise," he says. He is right.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1256.0.text.HmmISupposeSoOtherwise=\n"Hmm. I suppose so. Otherwise I would be showing too much attachment to this pickaxe, after all. All right. You can have it, but only if you swear that you'll bring it back."\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1261.0.option.SwearAndGoBackTo=Swear and go back to the [Map]
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1268.0.text.UnfortunatelyAsItTurnsOut=\nUnfortunately, as it turns out the southern part of the dungeon has been severely damaged by the villainous Zmey Chernobyl. The corridors lie in ruins; the fanciful creatures that once prowled these parts have had to find new professions. It's a tragic sight, a powerful reminder of why a hero is needed.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1281.0.text.THEMYSTERIOUSTEMPLEYoureNot=\n\n~~~ THE MYSTERIOUS TEMPLE ~~~\n\nYou're not quite sure how you found this place, but you can sense its power. Even though the temple consists of no more than a few columns surrounding a fishbowl, an ancient magic infuses the place.\n\nA man dressed in rough robes approaches you. "You have come!" he says. "You have come to hear the word of Talos!"\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1291.0.option.KillHim=Kill him!
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1292.0.option.RunAway=Run away!
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1299.0.text.InexplicablyEnragedByTheOld=\nInexplicably enraged by the old man's words, you attack him. You grab a book of Ancient Greek mythology which you find next to a column and beat him to death with it, screaming incoherently all the while.\n\nYou feel better.\n\nIn fact, you feel a lot better! You also feel very sleepy.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1308.0.option.SleepInTheOldMans=Sleep in the old man's bed
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1313.0.text.THEMYSTERIOUSTEMPLEYouHave=\n\n~~~ THE MYSTERIOUS TEMPLE ~~~\n\nYou have nothing more to do here.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_KnightQuest.Ln1328.0.text.OnTheNextMorningYou=\nOn the next morning, you open your eyes with a new sense of purpose. You're no longer afraid of failure. You remember the words of the greatest of all sages, the holy Quantum: "Failure is just an opportunity to learn something new."\n\nYour power has grown.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0016.0.text.SERIOUSSAMTHETEXTENCOUNTER=\n\nSERIOUS SAM:\nTHE TEXT ENCOUNTER\n\nA very serious experience.\nOnly for serious people.\nIf you're not serious, don't play this.\nSeriously.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0035.0.text.WrittenBy401InspiredBy=\nWritten by 401.\n\nInspired by the tales of Sam Stone that are documented in the Archive, and by the obstinate ghost in the machine that calls itself Milton.\n\nThis is better than The_Blacksmith's work by far.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0050.0.text.YouAreSamSeriousStone=\nYou are Sam "Serious" Stone. \nYou've fought the invaders on more planets than you can count. \nYou've won battles against hordes that seemed impossible to overcome.\nYou've kicked asses that seemed impossible to kick.\nYou fight like a Sirian Werebull and you make love like a rocket launcher.\nYou're the #1 badass of your age and weight.\nYou're a friggin' one-man army.\n\nBut there's one battle you're failing to win... the battle against ennui.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0063.0.option.Ennui=Ennui?
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0068.0.text.EnnuiAFeelingOfSadness=\nEnnui. A feeling of sadness and boredom. It's been creeping up on you ever since the mission in Rome. Man, that **** was not fun. In fact, **** that ******* **** and *** ******* *********** ***!\n\nSo, yeah, ennui. You sit there in a cold room in the military base and you feel like even a good old flamethrower couldn't warm you up.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0075.0.option.SeriouslyEnnui=Seriously? Ennui?
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0080.0.text.OhYeahSeriouslyEnnuiSays=\n'Oh yeah, seriously,' Ennui says smirkingly. 'I mean, what did you expect? You thought the war against Mental was over? You keep winning victories, but you're gonna lose the war.'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0085.0.option.Resist=Resist
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0086.0.option.GiveIn=Give in
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0091.0.text.EnnuiTicklesYourChinCome=\nEnnui tickles your chin.\n\n'Come on, big man. Admit it. What's the point? Is shooting another horde of headless exploding dudes gonna make you feel better?'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0098.0.option.ArgueThatThisFeelingIs=Argue that this feeling is temporary
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0099.0.option.ArgueThatTheWarCan=Argue that the war can be won
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0104.0.text.EnnuiPatsYouOnThe=\nEnnui pats you on the head.\n\n'I can see that you want to admit it. You've asked yourself the same thing: what's the point? Is shooting another horde of headless exploding dudes gonna make you feel better?'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0117.0.text.LookYouSayIMay=\n'Look,' you say, 'I may feel like a dead monkey right now, but that's just cause I kicked so much ass, they named a new type of boot after me. So yeah, I'm down, but I've been down before. I never stay down.'\n\nEnnui laughs at your bravado, unimpressed.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0125.0.option.ArgueThatMeaningIsConstructed=Argue that meaning is constructed
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0130.0.text.DoesItLookBadSometimes=\n'Does it look bad sometimes?' you ask rhetorically. 'Sure, wars ain't easy, and sometimes they don't seem to want to end. But we're gonna win. And I'm gonna be there when we do, even if I have to chase Mental to the other end of the galaxy.'\n\nEnnui laughs at your bravado, unimpressed.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0143.0.text.WhatYouThinkThisIs=\n'What, you think this is tough? Listen up, Ennui. Life's tough. Life's a struggle. I knew this philosopher, right? Man, he was nasty, brutish and short. But he said...'\n\nYou start explaining your argument that life is fundamentally a struggle, and that meaning is derived from how that struggle is fought, but Ennui yawns.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0151.0.option.ArgueThatExistenceIsInherently=Argue that existence is inherently positive
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0156.0.text.YouAttemptToArgueThat=\nYou attempt to argue that life does not have an inherent meaning, but that meaning can be constructed through self-reflection and the setting of goals, but Ennui yawns.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0167.0.text.YouArgueThatAnIndividual=\nYou argue that an individual can only find meaning within the greater social context. You quote Einstein: 'The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave.' You couldn't be the badass that you are if your actions didn't exist within this social context and serve a purpose greater than yourself.\n\nEnnui sneers and says you're just trying to intellectually justify the fact that you're a brainless shooter guy.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0174.0.option.ListenToEnnuiSomeMore=Listen to Ennui some more
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0179.0.text.YouArgueThatMereExistence=\nYou argue that mere existence is already a positive fact, since non-existence is considerably more likely, meaning that all life has an inherently positive slant. To not merely exist, but to also be as awesome as Serious Sam, can then only be truly positive, and in the long run that positivity must win out.\n\nEnnui starts giggling.\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0191.0.text.YouSeeSamYouCan=\n'You see, Sam, you can talk and talk and talk, but I'm always gonna outtalk you. I'll twist your words in your mouth and make you feel like an idiot. I'll take every positive thing you say and turn it into something horrible by reducing your arguments to their most extreme and absurd forms.'\n\nEnnui laughs in your face. You feel weak.\n\n

TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0205.0.text.InconsistentWhoEverClaimedI=\n'Inconsistent? Who ever claimed I was consistent? I don't need to be consistent, you big oaf, because I'm not making any claims. I don't believe anything. I am merely suggesting that maybe you should consider the possibility that perhaps life is a dull and individuality a pointless illusion.'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0210.0.option.SHOOTENNUI=SHOOT ENNUI
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0215.0.text.ReallySamPooJokesI=\n'Really, Sam? Poo jokes? I thought you were better than this. You're not like that other guy, that nuclear aristocrat who's always late to the party. No, you're supposed to be the real deal, a real hero. What happened to you, man? Did you recognize the inescapably pointless nature of existence? Is that why you're talking to me like that?'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0225.0.text.WhoaThereYouMustBe=\n'Whoa there, you must be going a little crazy. Do you really wanna argue that? Because I'm gonna point out a million problems with that argument, even if it has nothing to do with what we were talking about. Like, if people are citizens, are frogs citizens? Do you think frogs can vote? Have you seen any frogs sending letters to the editor complaining about the decline in moral standards lately?'\n\n
TermDlg.DLC_Sam.Ln0235.0.text.IWantToArgueThat=\n'I want to argue that... I'm tired of listening to your crap,' you growl, and shoot Ennui in the face.\n\nYou immediately feel better.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSeriously.\n\n-- THE END --\n\n
