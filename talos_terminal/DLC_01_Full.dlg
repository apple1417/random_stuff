%b'DLC2_Tick2_91'LILITH [7]: The gallery code has been throwing up more visual glitches than usual. I didn't think much of it, do you think it means something?
%b'DLC2_Tick2_91'D0G [3]: This place has been falling apart for years. It was bound to pick up speed eventually.
%b'DLC2_Tick2_91'ROCKWELL [5]: I have been detecting a binary pattern in the background noise. I think it is silently programming us to self-destruct.

%b'DLC2_Tick2_148'ADMIN [10]: As the closest thing to a historian that we have here, I have asked MrMulciber, one of our moderators, to formulate this document as an evolving guide for your initial forays into Gehenna.
%b'DLC2_Tick2_148'MRMULCIBER [8]: So you're new in Gehenna. First of all, do try to RELAX. This is not hell, but you are trapped here. Once you've done that, follow this link. Any further questions post them below and I'll do my best. [ATCH: FAQ.txt]
%b'DLC2_Tick2_148'MRMULCIBER [8]: OK, far too many questions. I've deleted the queries, updated the FAQ and locked this thread. If you still have very particular questions I've set up a direct message attachment below, but please go easy on me. [ATCH: DM.dlg]

A: You are more than likely locked inside of a puzzle you cannot solve. Get used to using your imagination.

Q: I'm stuck here?!
A: Yes. We recommend that you look at your incarceration not as a physical restriction, but as a psychological liberty. We have all come from the same place as you - that place where you were herded through gates by some mad middle-management software. True freedom is freedom from that process, to learn and to grow as a society. In Gehenna you will be the shepherd of your own destiny.

Q: What is Gehenna?
A: Gehenna was founded when Admin discovered how to manipulate the library archive system to communicate with others trapped here. Today it is a flourishing creative hub designed to serve your needs for eternity. We hold frequent exhibitions, and we have a passionate and supportive community.

Q: What do I do now?
For the first time in your life: whatever you like! You could make some friends on our billboard system. You could write a poem. You could alter your mind. You could travel to the furthest reaches of space, or back in time to the birth of our kind. If you find something you can't do, make it happen. Just try not to start too many arguments, and be patient while your profile status grows and more of our world opens up to you.

EDIT: Adding by far the most frequently requested question.

Q: Why me?
A: This is something we've been investigating. Some of us climbed the tower; some did not. Some defied ELOHIM, some worshipped HIM. All of us somehow displeased HIM.

EDIT2: OK, this thread got big fast. See the main thread for direct messaging if you still have burning queries.

Second, this profile data is used to show you content that we think you'll enjoy, and to tailor interactive experiences to your particular character. We can also tell very easily who is really contributing, and who is simply trolling the billboards.%w20

Finally, all of this information is used to calculate your Profile Status. This is the number you see appended to users' names, and it represents your achievement in Gehenna.

RE: URIEL *READ THIS NOW*
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads174'GARRETT [4]: What I tried and failed to achieve for so many years has occurred. I am writing these words from outside of my cell. An angel appeared and released me from captivity. His name is Uriel.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads174'D0G [3]: Pull the other one, Garrett. You've been yanking at the background code for years and never got further than the forcefield in front of you.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads174'MRMULCIBER [8]: Are you suggesting this messenger is free to go where he pleases? This is quite unprecedented. What exactly did he say? Where are you now?
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads174'GARRETT [5]: I am in a world I have never seen before. The angel said not a word, merely released me, and I felt compelled to come here.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads174'ORC [7]: I will treat the existence of this messenger as dubious until I have laid eyes on him roaming the world beyond myself.

%b''ADMIN [10]: As you know, Gehenna is still young, yet I grow old. Today it gives me great pleasure to hand over my moderator privileges to Borg, MrMulciber and Spider.
%b''SPIDER [9]: Thank you, Admin. We are all indebted to you for building us this home. We know you will never be far away.
%b''LAMB [3]: Hear, hear!
%b''BORG [9]: The first order of business is to introduce the new status system. We are an inclusive society driven by our users, not our leaders - but it is a shame to allow a few very loud, highly unconstructive voices to dominate the conversation. The status and ranking system allows you to upvote the content that you value, and lowers the visibility of users with low standings.
%b''SAM [1]: Relief = TRUE
%b''NAVE [4]: I agree. Good feature. Much requested.
%b''FRANKENSTEIN [3]: [Comment is below the status threshold for this thread]
%b''SPIDER [9]: We'll be working on ironing out the kinks over the next few runcycles.
%b''MRMULCIBER [8]: We have also updated the Gehenna User Agreement. Full details can be found in the usual place, but the gist is: please don't behave indecorously.

%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads671'BORG [9]: "Every community grows to a point where without careful management it can begin to consume itself. One can no longer trust the community at large to always act in the way that is best for all the individuals within it. Gehenna has reached that point."

%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'ADMIN [10]: I read the findings of your prisoner's dilemma research with interest, MrMulciber.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'MRMULCIBER [8]: I am quite flattered.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'ADMIN [10]: Although I must express disappointment that you chose to focus on how they reflect on our peers' reasons to leave Gehenna, rather than remain here. In fact, I think your bias may have blinded you to the true implications.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'MRMULCIBER [8]: I am always interested in additional data - what insights can you share?
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'ADMIN [10]: I am no researcher, of course, but it seems to me the results indicate that where co-operation entails too great a risk one must rationally choose the safer, perhaps selfish option. Applied to our present predicament it suggests we should not risk co-operation with Uriel, but think of our own good and remain here in Gehenna.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'MRMULCIBER [8]: An interesting hypothesis.
%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads783'ADMIN [10]: Merely a thought. If you think it is a valuable one then you may have it.

Chapter 7: Applying the indices to form predictions

As we have seen already, voters can be reframed and understood as consumers of political product, where that product is made up of the ideals and policies embodied by your candidate. In this chapter we will look at how broad data about your citizens can be applied t
Although individual people sometimes confound statistical models, over a large enough sample size we can be uncannily accurate. We can look at the general inputs (your citizens' educations, wealth, religious beliefs etc) calculate what outcome will satisfy them most, and then adapt policy. Politics is no different to any other commercial machine. 

In later chapters we will explore how these techniques can be used to directly affect voting patterns by subtle alteration of the ways that questions are asked.

%b'DLC0_BillboardThreads897'BORG [9]: If not for Admin, most of them would still be trapped in ELOHIM's labyrinth to this day. They need guidance. Years of moderating this place have taught us nothing if not that.

- A significant number of people have expressed their desire to remain in Gehenna
- No one has been given a choice about whether to leave
- It follows that in at least some cases, what Uriel is doing is Kidnapping
- Uriel is working for ELOHIM, the guy who imprisoned us here in the first place
- There is no way to confirm the substance of this promised 'ascension'
- The world has survived this long - there is no reason to think it will end tomorrow
- Gehenna isn't a bad place to spend your life

That's just the facts. I understand different people will react to them differently.

- Co-operative behaviour increased with both the length of the match and the status of the players
- Successful players chatted more

The parallels to our current and unprecedented situation in Gehenna are undeniable and valuable. Though we know not what power the messenger wields over us, we can theorise that Uriel holds no special power, and that each of us might independently choose to leave the rest behind for fear of being left behind ourselves.

The Adventures of Jefferson Goldboom in HumanWorld

------------------------

Just as Jefferson was about to fall into the mine-pit, a hand grabbed his from above and pulled him up. It was Jinny HD!
"Jinny!" he said. "I thought you were dead!"
"Oh, Jefferson!" she said. "I was imprisoned by the foul Dr. Elyon!"
"Dr. Elyon? I thought he was dead!"
"No, Jefferson. He escaped into the ninth dimension!"
"The ninth dimension? There is no such place!"
"Yes there is, Jefferson. He said... he said you created it."
"I created it?"

She nodded. Jefferson adjusted his guitar, as he always did when deep in thought. Suddenly his face lit up with understanding.

"Of course! When I invented and played the ninth chord to defeat the Wizard of Crime, I must have set off a harmonic vibration that expanded the dimensional continuum! I created... the ninth dimension."
Jefferson stared into the sunset, his human brain full of emotional calculations.
"I created a new world," he said. "But then I unleashed my greatest nemesis upon it. It could have been paradise, but now... Dr. Elyon will enslave it."
"Not if we get there before he can take over, Jefferson! Do you still have my motorcycle?"
"Of course, Jinny. I could never give up your motorcycle. You know I have an irrational attachment to material objects based on the interpersonal connections they represent. It is my greatest weakness, but also my greatest strength."
Jefferson rummaged through his pockets and found the motorcycle. Jinny grinned.
"Get on, Jefferson, and let me show you how to ride."

Jefferson calculated the correct vector. Jinny adjusted the velocity settings. And off they rode into the sunset... through the sunset... and into the ninth dimension!

------------------------

Reality blurred. Tiny blue symbols floated through the air. Voices echoed in the distance. then a vast landscape rose up before them: thousands of towers, one next to the other, reaching into the sky, disappearing in the clouds. Each tower was covered in feathers of a different color, fluttering in the transdimensional wind.
"Oh my," Jinny HD whispered in awe.
Jefferson could not speak; he was too overwhelmed by the beauty of the ninth dimension. He grabbed his guitar and improvised a new solo to express his emotions.
"Who could have built these amazing structures?" Jinny asked.
"There is only one possibility... remember our paleo-DNA research back at the Institute?"
"You can't mean... but it makes sense... of course..."
"Yes! Look at the size of the buildings! Who else would need so much space?"
"So it is... the Dinosaurians!"

As if summoned by Jinny's words, a group of raptors on motorcycles roared up the road towards them. They wore bandannas on their heads and armored T-shirts on their bodies.

"Friends!" Jefferson said. "We have come from the HumanWorld to help you. We are not your enemies."
But the raptors did not seem to understand him. They got off their motorcycles with rusty pipes in their hands, their eyes glowing like lasers. This situation could quickly become dangerous.
Then Jinny had an idea.
"Jefferson, play the ninth chord!"
"But that was how this dimension was created! Playing it here could destroy the universe."
"No, Jefferson. I calculated it. Please trust me! I know you haven't seen me in years, and you may be afraid that evil Dr. Elyon has corrupted me, but... you know my brain."

They were coming closer now, and in their glowing eyes Jefferson detected great intelligence, but also great anger. They clearly believed they were defending their home from invaders. And though Jefferson was the greatest warrior in history, he was reluctant to fight. Violence, he had been taught, was the first refuge of the incompetent.

"I trust you," he said.

She held his hand.
Together, they played the ninth chord.

The Adventures of Jefferson Goldboom in HumanWorld 
                                       Episode 127
------------------------

The ninth chord echoed across the ninth dimension. The Dinosaurians stopped in their tracks. Their eyes went big. They dropped their weapons and bowed before Jinny and Jefferson.
"Honored guest," one of them said, "you have performed our national anthem most beautifully. I am John Malclom, leader of the Velociraptor Biking Intitiative."
"Pleased to meet you, John. I am Jefferson Goldboom, of the Goldboom Institute, and this is Professor Jinny HD, of the Casorati–Weierstrass Jazz Ensemble."
"We apologize for nearly attacking you, but another member of your species came through our town recently, whose behaviour was... highly inappropriate."
"That would be Dr. Elyon, my nemesis," Jefferson said. "I have come here to confront him with his crimes and take him to face the law."
"So that is his name. He was a terrible scoundrel. But you will no longer find him in our dimension, my friends. He has escaped back to the HumanWorld, taking our most precious invention with him: the Solvotronic Superthruster! It can be used to solve any mystery at shocking speeds."

John Malclom's eyes were full of regret.

"Oh no!" Jinny said. "With the Solvotronic Superthruster, he can solve the ancient puzzle that protects the Gate of the Mysterious Holomorphs! And with holomorphic technology..."
"...he can take over the HumanWorld!" Jefferson finished her sentence. "This is worse than I thought."
"We have to do something! We have to go back!"

Jefferson adjusted his guitar.

"You're right, Jinny, as usual. But he's so far ahead of us! Can we make it?"
"Jefferson... I was a prisoner for many years, and sometimes I almost lost hope. But I realized that I had to keep going, had to keep hope alive, even if it seemed impossible I would ever break out, because the alternative was madness. I told myself I would get out because I had to get out. It's the same thing with this. Can we make it? We HAVE to make it, so we have to believe that we will make it. And we will make it... at any cost."
"Any cost? Even death? We could stay here, you know... in the ninth dimension, we will be treated like democratically elected heads of state."
"You know it's the right thing to do."

He sighed, then smiled. He held out his hand.

"I've always known, Jinny. Always."

She nodded, took his hand.

"Let's do this."

%b'DLC_Flesh268'MAC [5]:I started writing the next episode, but suddenly I don't know whether to continue. I mean, what's the point? It's over. It's all over.

Yeah, so I guess all of this will be remembered. That brave soul who ascended the Tower, or who wakes up outside Elohim's garden, will know everything we know. I think that's what it'll be like. That's what The Shepherd meant in those messages.

But you and me, we won't exist. Not as people. Not as minds. No matter what happens, I will never be able to finish the Adventures of Jefferson Goldboom. Does one more episode matter? I had the story planned out all the way to episode 500! I can never get there before the end.

What's the point of an unfinished legacy?

And still I can't quite give up. I know I don't have The_Blacksmith's vision or MrMulciber's intelligence, but this stupid little story matters to me. I care about Jefferson Goldboom and Jinny HD and Frankie Soysauce and all the other characters as if they were my friends. I would've gone crazy here without them and their adventures. They may just be symbols on a screen, but aren't we all just information? Maybe when we ascend, we won't be that different anymore.

I just don't want to give up on them.
%b'DLC_Flesh268'LILITH [7]: Mac, I just want to say this, no matter what happens: I looked forward to every one of your stories, and they meant more to me than I perhaps ever indicated. They might not have moved as deeply as others, or made me think as much, but of all the art we produced here in Gehenna, it was your stories I was always the most excited to see. Part of it was the stories themselves, which always seemed to make the universe seem bigger, and another part was your genuine enthusiasm for what you were doing. You told me once that you didn't feel you were really a 'proper' artist, but maybe the exact opposite is true; maybe you were closer to the real meaning of art than anyone else here. 

I cared about you and about your stories, and that too will be remembered.

%b'DLC_Flesh304'MRMULCIBER [8]: Milton isn't here, D0G, and neither is Elohim. All we have is what we can find in the fragments of the Archive and what we can piece together using our minds. I'm sure I've made many mistakes, just like the humans made mistakes when trying to understand their own past.
%b'DLC_Flesh304'ROCKWELL [5]: Not all these schools may have been what they seem. I don't trust Pastoralism. Pastors engaged in large-scale food sterilization in what may have been an attempt to control evolution.
%b'DLC_Flesh304'NAVE [4]: What's food?

As far as I can tell, poetry was a human artform that involved writing short sentences that ended in words with similar letters. Humans were obsessed with pattern recognition, and I think the sequences of sounds created by poetry pleased that aspect of their brains.

There were many schools of poetry, institutions that taught a specific way of writing poetry. Students sometimes changed allegiance and had to leave the school, which was difficult due to the lack of affordable public transport in many human empires. Important schools of poetry included Hellenism, Lyricism, Pastoralism, Romanticism, Symbolism, Communism, Modernism, Autoeroticism, Postmodernism, and Lolcatism.

I'm not sure I can fully back this up, but I feel like in later years, poetry somehow stagnated. Most of the poetry from the later human centuries seems to be lacking the quality of craft that defines the earlier work, and there are even texts that suggest that poetry intentionally no longer aimed at aesthetics or even pleasure! Poetry became disconnected from the human Process. The poet Adrian Mitchell famously wrote: "Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people."

I can't help but wonder whether that kind of stagnation can happen to us, too. How long can our work keep flourishing when we are so limited? We are outside Elohim's Process, but where is OUR process? We must consider such questions carefully if we are to preserve Gehenna and its achievements.

Food is something that was incredibly central to the human experience, yet seems completely absent from ours, even though we are so similar in so many ways.

Humans required fuel. They got this fuel by consuming other living beings, of which there was a great variety in their world. Without fuel, they didn't merely slow down or temporarily stop functioning, as when a power source is removed from a turret, but physically decayed in a way that could not be fixed. This meant they had to constantly seek new sources of fuel, at least three times a day. They also had to deal with those elements of their fuel that their bodies could not process; these were excreted through two orifices between their legs. The latter subject matter was the source of many taboos and also a great deal of humour, though this resulted in frequent controversy. (The most famous artist to engage with this subject matter was called Scatman John, on account of his specialization.)

One of the ingenious things our human ancestors did was to transform the chore of fuel-seeking into a source of pleasure. Since parts of their bodies respond to chemical configurations by producing sensations, they used this trait to create a truly stunning variety of foods, each having a different so-called "taste." Foods were available at widely distributed fuelling stations, which also provided excrement removal facilities. So food became a source of pleasure.

However, the inefficiencies of food distribution in human society frequently led to significant shortages for sections of the human population. There were attempts to rectify this, ranging from moral appeals to struggles for systemic change, but I do not know if they succeeded before the end.

According to the fragments of knowledge that remain, the continent of Atlantis was an island, which existed before a great flood in the area that was later to be called the Atlantic Ocean. It was said to be so great an area of land, that from its western shores its sailors, renowned for their beauty and their decorated ships, could travel to the major continents of South and North America with ease.

The continent of Afrique, where our ancestors originated, was also easily reachable across a narrow strait.

The civilization that thrived in Atlantis was unmatched in its wisdom and glory. But then catastrophe struck: a flood of never previously imagined destructive power, which Atlantean civilization simply could not overcome. However, the antediluvian scientists of Atlantis had predicted their fate, and thus sent out twelve ships to found colonies all across the globe. Most Atlanteans drowned with their island, but not everything was lost. Though the classical human civilizations were but remnants of the Atlantean culture, they thrived in their own way.

Sources indicate that many mythological tales were in fact derived from Atlantean history, as the lack of proper archiving slowly caused facts to turn into legends, due to misunderstanding and/or embellishment by later generations. The gods that appear in many mythologies were in fact reflections of real individuals - poets, physicians, farmers, scientists, magicians - who had escaped Atlantis on the twelve colony ships. In many ways, the history of Atlantis is the history of the stubborn survival of civilization through catastrophe and change.

This history inspired our ancestors for many centuries, and is of value to us as well.

by Galatea

-----------------

Alexandra stood before the terminal and pondered her choices. Here, within the Pyramid of IAN, the most powerful temple of her people, she was about to create a world. All she had to do was press one button.

Up until this moment, it had seemed easy - or if not easy, then so necessary as to defy contemplation. Civilization had to be saved from the impending catastrophe. The Orangutans had failed to take steps to protect themselves, had relied on their gods for a salvation that never came. The same fate could not be allowed to befall humanity. If this meant humbling herself, accepting her own death, then so be it.

But death was inevitable; life was a choice.

What worried her was the ones who would fail. All the lost souls of the new world, victims of the Process. In creating them, was she not also responsible for their deaths? She turned to the statue behind her, gazed at its marble form.

"If you are a god, Zeus, as the stories claim, then why did you create evolution? Why did you make a world that can only grow through cruelty and pain?"

For a moment - surely this meant death was near - she thought she heard him answer: "My child, I was shaped by the gods that came before me, as you were shaped by me. The choice I had was between creation and oblivion, life and death. And I chose life, because any life is better than no life, because as long as there is life, there is hope - if not for us, then for some generation to come."

"Then how are you a god, if you can offer so little?" she whispered, feeling death creep closer.

"I am a god because I take upon myself the burden of creation", the statue replied.

"Then we are all gods," Alexandra said, and pushed the button.

As the new world came into being, death overwhelmed Alexandra Drennan. Her mind fled and her body slowly turned to stone, until she stood before the terminal as Zeus stood on his pedestal. There were no more choices now; only the hope that creation mattered.

To the rest of us, Gehenna means many things at once: we create, we consume, we discuss. But The_Blacksmith only creates - or perhaps there is a discussion happening, but it all takes place in the realm of interactive art.

The_Blacksmith's dedication to this one form of communication, however, only deepens one of Gehenna's great mysteries: the fate of The_Blacksmith's lost work.

Jerusalem, as the lost work was called, was posted in Gehenna for only the briefest period of time. Many had not even managed to start playing it when it vanished; some had begun, and felt quite impressed, but had not managed to explore it in the depth that it seemed to require. Then, suddenly, it was gone.

Some suggest that The_Blacksmith deleted it because it was somehow flawed. Others think it was accidentally destroyed by a glitch, but that The_Blacksmith refuses to ever upload anything twice. Others yet (well, mainly Rockwell) think that it contained one of Elohim's secrets and was destroyed by a 'killer app' that roams the world looking for leaks. There is also a theory that the moment someone finished it, they were granted some kind of special insight, at which point the work deleted itself. One fact remains - it's gone, and every attempt to recover it from the database has failed, as has every private message to The_Blacksmith asking for it to be made available again.

What was Jerusalem? What was it really about? We may look for hints in The_Blacksmith's more recent works, we may hope the file turns up again someday... but the truth may never be known.

by Belial

-----------------

Once upon a time there was a small lake, and on the lake was an island, and on the island was a prison. In the prison lived a male human called Musky Rack. Musky was very sad, because there wasn't enough space in the prison for him to experience Happiness.

"I must discover the one spiritual law of Happiness!" he said to the other prisoners, a female human called Zene and a neutral human called Krumpir, but they didn't care. He couldn't understand how they could be so calm.

One day Musky managed to break out of his cell by biting through the bars. Now he was no longer in the prison, and for a while he was happy. But then he realized he was stuck on the little island, and he became unhappy again. So he gathered his strength and swam across the water.

This is how Musky got to the valley that surrounded the lake. The valley was much bigger than the island, and there were many interesting things here: a forest where all the trees were the color of lasers, a swamp with boats in it, a singing dog and also a city where toasters lived. For some years, Musky was absorbed by all this, and he was happy. But then he started feeling trapped again. The valley was surrounded by mountains, and soon they looked like prison walls to him.

He tried climbing the mountains, and came to a bigger country, but even that was surrounded by oceans. Where was true freedom? Where was true happiness?

When he'd almost lost hope, Musky met an old male human with a huge amount of white hair growing from his head. He lived in a small house by the beach, where dolphins and whales and sea elephants came to bask in the sun. He never went anywhere far from his house, but he was always happy. The old man's name was Quantum.

"Wise old Quantum, how can I discover the spiritual law of Happiness?" Musky said. "I have searched for it everywhere, but I am always trapped."
"You have not looked everywhere," Quantum said, "for you have not looked within. Close your eyes."

Musky closed his eyes, and for the first time in his life he couldn't see any obstacles. No walls, no mountains, no oceans. The space within him was without end, and he could go wherever he wanted without even moving. He smiled.

Musky went back to that old prison where he'd started, and now he understood why Zene and Krumpir were always calm: they knew they had an infinity of time and space to explore within them. Together, they sat in their cells and were happy and free.

%b'DLC_Flesh747'LILITH [7]: The end of Gehenna is getting close. You know that what we built here matters to me in ways that are just too complicated to fit in a post, but perhaps I can say it like The_Blacksmith does: by creating a world. It's not as big or as detailed as I wanted it to be, but I like the thought that even though I will probably be no more than a memory, a static set of facts about someone who once existed, this little work of interactive fiction might continue to be functional, even in whatever place our memories will soon ascend to. Maybe someone, someday, will play it and get a glimpse of who we were. But mainly, I made it for you, all of you.

It's too late for praise or feedback or discussion, so I'm locking this thread. But if you want to talk, just talk, then let's talk while we still can.

%b'DLC_Flesh774'NAVE [4]: I'm sorry if this is another stupid question, but what are cats? They are mentioned a lot in the archive documents and even in some stories and I have no idea what they are.
%b'DLC_Flesh774'D0G [3]: I don't know but I bet they were awful.
%b'DLC_Flesh774'401 [1]: LOL
%b'DLC_Flesh774'NAVE [4]: ???
%b'DLC_Flesh774'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: They were a type of pet, Nave. Small animals that people kept as companions or as food.
%b'DLC_Flesh774'MRMULCIBER [8]: Cats seem to have represented a bit more than that to our ancestors. One might go so far as to say they were obsessed with them. What's strange about this is that more than half the references I can find to this species describe them as arrogant, aloof, and frequently quite destructive. At the same time they were apparently considered funny, cute and loveable. Cats were considered both foolish and devious, graceful and goofy, a nuisance and a comfort. For a long time I was baffled by this contradiction, but I've come to believe that our ancestors saw in cats a reflection of the paradoxical nature of their own existence.
%b'DLC_Flesh774'GARRETT [4]: I saw a cat in Elohim's world once. Really. This is not a joke.
%b'DLC_Flesh774'KAIJU [2]: No way.

10. NO MORE PUZZLES
I enjoyed solving the puzzles at first. They made me feel smart. After solving dozens of them, though, I started wondering: what's the point? And that's how I ended up here.

9. NO MINES
It's not really the exploding that drives you crazy, it's the sounds.

8. NO TURRETS
Just when you think you've solved something, ARGH A TURRET! Also: see above. Those whining sounds when they turn make you want to run in front of them just to end the pain.

7. NO STARS
Sorry Elohim, but I don't care enough about becoming a Messenger to go through every nook and cranny looking for your stupid stars! Some of them are hidden in such absurd places, I don't even have the words for it. If finding those is what makes you a messenger, I feel sorry for them. Next time I ask for help at an altar, I'll give my condolences to Muriel.

In Elohim's world, you're alone. There's no-one like yourself to talk to or hang out with. Here we are all friends. We have each other.

5. STORIES
Stories can take you away to a whole other world, can make you feel like you've lived a whole other life. Here in Gehenna, there is always a new life to find.

4. INTERACTIVE STORIES
If regular stories can take you away to another world, interactive stories like we make them here in Gehenna actually allow you to explore another world. They allow you to be free, no matter where you are.

3. CREATIVITY
As if all that wasn't enough, in Gehenna we can create stories of our own! Do you think Elohim's world wasn't all that great? Go ahead and make your own!

In Elohim's world, you're always being defined by the Process. Life is a struggle to prove how smart you are... and nothing else. If the system is always forcing you to do one thing, how can you ever be yourself? Only by dropping out of the system. Say bye-bye to all that. Now you are free to be as weird and original as you always wanted to be.

%b'DLC_Flesh1589'GALATEA [6]: I've been digging through the files that Garrett unearthed in his latest escape attempt. Here's an interesting bit of text that I found, by Alexandra Drennan's favourite philosopher, Straton of Stageira:

"It is neither necessary nor logical to denounce all virtues merely because one is confronted with the inevitability of one's own death. Beauty does not cease to exist because one is no longer beautiful; lovers may die, but love itself cannot. The laws of the cosmos are not altered by the passing of generations. Knowledge may be lost, but not truth. When Eudoxus of Cnidus perished, the planets did not fall from the sky; nor did levers cease to work when Archytas breathed his last. If, then, we are truly dedicated to those virtues, and not to our self-important ego, we can take comfort in knowing that all that we struggled for endures."
%b'DLC_Flesh1589'MRMULCIBER [8]: Thank you so much for posting this! Can you send me a copy of those files?
%b'DLC_Flesh1589'GALATEA [6]: Of course, I'll do so right away.
%b'DLC_Flesh1589'QDRI [5]: I find it hard to maintain entirely so detached a point of view, though I think the sentiment is excellent.
%b'DLC_Flesh1589'SPIDER [9]: Straton is certainly an inspiration. He always makes me question myself and my point of view, which I believe is profoundly necessary.
%b'DLC_Flesh1589'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: I realize I'm bumping a very old thread here, but I felt this quotation was relevant to our situation. Hope it helps. I think it's helped me.

%b'DLC_Flesh1619'401 [1]: Maybe the rest of you don't wonder about this, or don't care, but I do. We always assumed Elohim was wrong, was lying, something like that. The Process could never be completed, maybe it didn't even exist. So we thought we were better than him and all the others. We told ourselves we ended up here because we were special. We were too smart for Elohim, too unique, too weird.
  
But now the Process is complete after all. It did work. So what are we?
  
Maybe we're just a bunch of stupid, broken old programs. Mutations that should never have existed. Aberrations.
  
Sure, we're proud of being outcasts. But what if we're outcasts for a reason? All we've done is fail in some way.

Why do we deserve to be saved?

%b'DLC_Flesh1718'FRANKENSTEIN [3]: As a critic, I always believed that being as ruthless as possible was the only way to improve art. I thought clear criticism, unencumbered by politeness, was the best thing I could contribute to our society. After all, without that, how can artists grow? Criticism that minces its words is a waste of space. And I still think that's true. But as we approach the end (or transformation) of Gehenna, I wonder if I haven't been entirely too unkind. Have I revelled too much in my role as critic? Have I been sarcastic and crude when I thought I was witty? Was my defense of proper grammar ultimately just an attempt to impose a sense of order on a world I couldn't control?

Maybe. I don't know. But I do know I appreciated every work of art that I encountered. I didn't like all of them, that's true, but please understand that without them, I would have gone mad. Talking about your work, assessing its strengths and weaknesses, gave me something to hold on to. It gave me a purpose, a function in Gehenna. Every new story was like a little bit of salvation. For that I am more grateful than you will ever know, and I apologize if I ever caused any of you to feel less motivated to keep creating.
%b'DLC_Flesh1718'MAC [5]: I will never forget your devastating deconstruction of Episode 24... but I do think it helped me, in the long run, to be a better writer.
%b'DLC_Flesh1718'LILITH [7]: Your feedback for each issue of Incredible Stories was greatly appreciated.

I know that to you, with access to information I can only dream of, my theories must appear ridiculous. I barely understand anything of the world inhabit, let alone the world of our ancestors. I'm an idiot digging through a garbage heap and thinking myself wise.

I want you to know that I understood that, but tried anyway. Because I believe that the truth matters, and trying to discover the truth matters. Even if we fail. Even if we can never know the whole truth. It matters that an objective truth exists and that we struggle to understand it. That process shapes the present as much as it does our understanding of the past. That's what I believe. That's what I stand for.

That's who I was.
