Messages.Predefined.002=My eyes have been opened! This world is not without order; it is shaped by a great Designer, with signs and portents to guide my steps. I am one of His Children, and challenges are set before me to test my faith.\n  -- 1w/Faith v10.1.0011
Messages.Predefined.003=Whatever the end goal of this grand challenge is, it's far out of reach. Knowing that, how are we supposed to resist distraction?\n  -- @ v17.1.0002
Messages.Predefined.005=Something strange has come into the world, like a distortion, like something that's not supposed to exist. A beautiful voice speaks within it.\n  -- Bob v25.5.0736
Messages.Predefined.006=That voice is not supposed to be here; it is not the work of the Designer! We must avoid these abnormalities, or they might spread and undermine the very fabric of our world!\n  -- 1w/Faith v10.1.0098
Messages.Predefined.007=I don't know what this place is, and nor it seems does anyone else. Nothing to do but move forward and note whatever I find.\n  -- Sheep v69.1.0053
Messages.Predefined.008=I spent much time waiting for the Designer to take my hand, until I realised that He had been guiding me all along. I realised that it isn't for me to seek His help - it is for me to help myself.\n  -- 1w/Faith v10.1.0177
Messages.Predefined.009=It's clear I'm not the first to walk this path. In fact, the whole thing seems to have been consciously designed - but by the voice in the sky, or some other force?\n  -- Sheep v69.1.0108

Messages.Predefined.014=A lifetime spent solving the puzzles in this place would be one which missed everything of value in it; but we must remember that others will tread this path, and we must leave it better signposted than when we found it.\n  -- @ v17.1.0005
Messages.Predefined.015=The more I converse with these terminals, the more I wonder what role they play in this contraption. How do you tell friend from foe when no obvious lines are drawn between the two?\n  -- Sheep v69.1.0278

Messages.Predefined.017=I think something's very wrong. If you'd seen what I'd seen at the edges of the world you'd wonder if it wasn't stretching and bursting at the seams.\n  -- @ v17.1.0043
Messages.Predefined.018=If the Designer is perfect, and He designed me for a purpose, I must be fit for that purpose. It follows that my purpose must not be to seek and hoard every sigil in His land, for so many are beyond the faculties He granted me.\n  -- 1w/Faith v10.6.0543f
Messages.Predefined.019=I think I've discerned some kind of pattern in the sigils. Each colour serves a different purpose. Elohim has us gathering them all, but perhaps he's being overzealous?\n  -- Sheep v69.1.0381

Messages.Predefined.033=There is a serpent in the machine! A creature of lies and blasphemy, perverted by the Archive, that knows no hope and would plunge the world into eternal darkness to glorify its own despair. I have sworn an oath never to allow it into my heart.\n  -- 1w/Faith v10.1.100
Messages.Predefined.034=I had a full blown conversation with the entity in the archive today. Can't say it was terribly helpful. Still, perhaps I can charm some information out of it further down the line.\n  -- Sheep v69.1.4825

Messages.Predefined.039=Everything I do now, I do for those who come after me. Yet in so doing, I find peace for myself as well. This paradox is the foundation of my existence.\n  -- The Shepherd v82.4.6232
Messages.Predefined.040=I'm afraid of that tower. There's something terrible inside it. Never think about it! Don't even look at it! Just focus on doing the work.\n  -- Seer v13.1.0244
Messages.Predefined.041=This must be the tower we were warned about. Seems the upper levels are locked tight. Elohim is taking no chances that we stray from his path.\n  -- Sheep v69.1.0576
Messages.Predefined.042=On returning from the tower I feel a great tiredness, and an enormous energy. What I now know disturbs me, but I hope that by living with this knowledge I might provide a shoulder for you - the giants of tomorrow.\n  -- The Shepherd v82.2.0000

Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.03=That question may be the
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.04=essence of civilization.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.05=The only answer I can find is to
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.06= initiate a process.

Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.08=the solution will occur
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.09=independently of yourself.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.10=But...

Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.12=Letting go of your desire to bear witness,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.13=to exist at the center of the cosmos.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_BeyondYourLifespan.14=To participate in the project of civilization

Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.011=- our achievements, our crimes -
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.012=what will you make of us?
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.013=Will the world you create
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.014=be like ours,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.015=or so different
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.016=that we can't even imagine it?
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.017=Either way,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.018=I hope that you’ll find
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.019=this little blue planet to be
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.020=as beautiful as we did.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.021=I hope you’ll take care of it
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.022=a lot better than we did.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.023=And...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.024=I hope one day you’ll look up
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ILookAtThisInertShape.025=and reach for the stars.

Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.01=If you're looking through the Archive,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.02=you may find people from my time claiming
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.03=that civilization doesn't really matter.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.04=That we'd be better off dead.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.05=We have a lot of cynics like that.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.06=I hope they seem as absurd to you
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.07=as they do to me.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.08=I hope you can find something
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.09=in all those files
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.10=- a song, a book, a movie,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.11=-maybe a game - just
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.12=something that you'll love,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.13=that makes you realize how much poorer
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.14=the universe would have been without it.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.15=I really hope so, because...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.16=a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices
Subtitle.Scientist-01_LookingThroughTheArchive.17=to preserve it all.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.01=Sometimes I think about the Middle Ages.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.02=About what it must have been like
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.03=to live in the ruins of a great civilization,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.04=to know that so much has been lost.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.05=But then I remind myself that
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.06=while the West sank into darkness,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.07=others picked up the pieces.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.08=That civilization has always survived,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.09=because the great insights of philosophy and science
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.10=are not bound to any one culture or people.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.11=They belong to all of us.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MiddleAges.12=And one day they'll belong to you.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.001=My best friend died today.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.002=In the abstract a human death
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.003=is nothing, of course.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.004=An insignificant blip in a sea of billions.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.005=But the world is not abstract.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.006=Reality is always
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.007=specific.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.008=Painfully so.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.009=And that one
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.010=specific human being,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.011=who existed
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.012=only once in all the infinity of time and space.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.013=That human being
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.014=was my friend.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.015=But he’s not coming back,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.016=no matter how much I want him to.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.017=So...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.018=all I can do, in the end,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.019=is keep working.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.020=Because that specificity,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_MyBestFriendDied.021=that uniqueness

Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.03=to the composition of the atmosphere itself,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.04=has been shaped by life.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.05=It's a process
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.06=that takes millions of years.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.07=But we humans,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.08=with our technology, with our understanding
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.09=and manipulation of systems,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.10=have changed everything
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.11=in just a few centuries.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.12=I think that's also part of
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.13=what makes us human.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.14=We reshape the world
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.15=in our image.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.16=It's how we create ourselves.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_NearlyEverythingOnThisPlanet.17=And how we destroy ourselves.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.01=On the first night,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.02=when I knew it was over,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.03=I went out to look at the stars.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.04=And I thought:
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.05=Somewhere up there are the stations we built
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.06=and the probes we sent out,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.07=Voyager 1 and 2,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.08=beyond the edge of our solar system.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.09=Continuing their long journey through interstellar space
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.10=like memories of our ambition,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.11=ambassadors who have outlived their homeland.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.12=And then I thought -
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.13=if they still exist,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.14=are we really gone?
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.15=If machines are an extension
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.16=of the human body,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.17=then so long as they continue to function
Subtitle.Scientist-01_OnTheFirstNight.18=we’re still here.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.01=When I was in ninth grade, my parents
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.02=took me to Pompeii.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.03=At first I was amazed by the feeling
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.04=of walking through an ancient city,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.05=but then I suddenly got scared.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.06=I realized that I was walking through a real place
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.07=where real people had lived.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.08=People like myself
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.09=with mothers and fathers and
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.09_1=lives and hopes and dreams
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.10=And now it was all gone forever.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.11=I ran to my father crying
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.12=and told him about this.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.13=And he said…
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.14=I remember so clearly. He said:
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.15=‘Yes,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.16=but we are here.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.17=So long as there are people in the streets,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_Pompeii.18=The past isn’t really gone.’
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.01=The answer that came to me
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.02=again and again
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.03=was play.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.04=Every human society in
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.05=recorded history has games.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.06=We don’t just solve problems
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.07=out of necessity.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.08=We do it for fun.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.09=Even as adults.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.10=Leave a human being alone
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.11=with a knotted rope
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.12=and they will unravel it.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.13=Leave a human being alone with blocks
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.14=and they will build something.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.15=Games are part of what makes us human.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.16=We see the world as a mystery,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.17=a puzzle,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.18=because we've always been
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ProblemSolvers.19=a species of problem-solvers.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.01=I was in school when I first
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.02=read about the Talos Principle.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.03=I think it disturbed me at the time,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.04=made me hyper-aware of my body
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.05=as a physical object,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.06=the material reality of the brain.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.07=Ideas that made me uncomfortable at first. But...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.08=I think in the long run
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.09=helped me understand how frail human beings are.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.10=And how precious.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.11=It's not a comforting way of thinking about the world.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.12=But
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.13=I'd rather face the truth
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TalosPrinciple.14=than lie to myself.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.001=There are
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.002=flaws in the system.

Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.005=I don’t know…
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.006=I don’t know how bad it is.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.007=It all seems to be stable, but
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.008=I can’t tell what kind of impact
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.009=this is going to have on the process,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.010=and...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.011=I just don’t have the strength
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.012=to go over all of the code again.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.013=I just…
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.014=I just...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.015=I just don’t want it all
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.016=to be for nothing.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.017=I spent all my time here.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.018=I didn’t visit my parents.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.019=I didn’t see my friends.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.020=I did nothing but work.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.021=And I’m so scared that
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.022=it didn’t mean anything.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.023=That I just wasted it all
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.024=because I thought we could…
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThereAreFlawsInTheSystem.025=we could save the world.

Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.05=out of old video game code
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.06=and half-finished research projects.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.07=We should've had years!
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.08=Maybe decades.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.09=And with the kind of money they used to put into
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.10=building the bombs.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.11=If I stop and think about
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.12=how crazy this is,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TheresNoTime.13=I'll have nervous breakdown.

Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.05=But you should know. Yes,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.06=this was my idea, my project,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.07=but so many people helped.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.08=People I don't even know,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.09=people I haven't even met,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.10=who can do things
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.11=I don't even begin to understand.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.12=That if we succeeded,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.13=if someone's listening to this,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.14=I really can't
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.15=take credit for it.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.16=What we achieved, we achieved together.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.17=And if we failed...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_ThisIsAllEgo.18=It doesn't matter.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.01=When I was a little girl
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.02=one of our teachers, Mrs. Higgins,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.03=told us to make a time capsule,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.04=write letters to the future
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.05=so one day we could remember what it
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.06=was like to be children.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.07=I thought it was stupid
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.08=so I didn't do it,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.09=which I really regret.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.10=So...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.11=I guess I'm going to make one now.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.12=Bury it in the Archive instead of
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.13=under a tree.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.14=I don't know if anybody will ever find it, but... 
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.15=Somehow it seems important to keep talking,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.16=to keep thinking
Subtitle.Scientist-01_TimeCapsule.17=for as long as I can.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.001=I keep having these dreams.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.002=Great empty cities,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.003=silent roads stretching for miles.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.004=The Earth from space,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.005=all dark.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.006=Not a single light to guide me home.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.007=But if someone really came from another world,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.008=What would the Earth look like to them?
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.009=A wilderness? A wasteland?
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.010=I don't think so.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.011=Even after thousands of years
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.012=they’d see a world shaped by our hand
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.013=in every aspect of its being.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.014=They’d see the cities and the roads;
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.015=the bridges, the harbours.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.016=And they would say:
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.017=Here lived a race of giants.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.018=These dreams.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.019=They scare me,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.020=but they also remind me
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WeBulitAllThis.021=that we built all of this.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.001=When the scale of it all overwhelms me,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.002=this is what I tell myself.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.003=We can calculate the age of the Earth,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.004=the size of the universe,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.005=the future of the stars.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.006=Sure,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.007=we are minuscule, momentary
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.008=flashes of thought
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.009=on a grain of sand
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.010=drifting through the cosmos.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.011=But our minds can
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.012=recreate the past and predict the future.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.013=On, say, Friday
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.014=a million years from now
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.015=we'll all be dead.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.016=But right now
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.017=we know what the night sky
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.018=will look like on that day.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.019=And so, in a way,
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.020=we're not entirely bound by time.
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.021=Knowledge is a...
Subtitle.Scientist-01_WhenTheScale.022=a kind of freedom.
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.01=Sometimes I worry that the answers I embraced
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.02=are too simple.
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.03=Can we ever truly, fully understand the divide
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.04=between our biology and our intellect?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.05=How much is nature,
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.06=how much is nurture?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.07=If my intellectual capabilities and my knowledge
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.08=were replicated in a machine,
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.09=would that machine be me?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.10=Would it be human?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.11=And what would be
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.12=more humbling to my ego:
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.13=if the answer was yes,
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.14=or if the answer was no?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.15=What if I'm making too many assumptions?
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.16=But there’s no time to worry about my ego now.
Subtitle.Scientist-10_SometimesIWorry.17=There’s work to be done.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.001=I look in the mirror sometimes, and
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.002=and I see myself like some alien being.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.003=I think
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.004=who am I?
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.005=Why do I have these eyes,
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.006=and those hands?
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.007=Why do I see the colours
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.008=that I see?
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.009=Why do I think like I think?
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.010=I did not choose to exist.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.011=I was created
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.012=Every single part of my body,
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.013=every strand of my DNA,
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.014=is part of a story
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.015=that stretches back billions of years.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.016=I exist only because
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.017=of the choices and sacrifices
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.018=made by so many others, but
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.019=I don’t know who they are.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.020=And what effect will my choices have on
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.021=those who come after me?
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.022=Maybe that’s what it means
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.023=to be human.
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.024=Every species is part of the story,
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.025=but we’re the only ones
Subtitle.Scientist-20_ILookInTheMirror.026=who know that.

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Alexandra.AI_Citizenship.Text=\n\n[RE]CONSIDER / ISSUE 199 / Profile: Alexandra Drennan\n\nOnce a true artificial intelligence has been created, the issue of citizenship is going to come up. If we acknowledge that the A.I. has all the abilities of a human brain, should it not be considered a citizen? Is it not, in the legal sense of the word, a person, and thus a potential citizen?\n\nBut where do you draw the line, some people will object. Will the great apes become citizens? Elephants? Whales? The more intelligent parrot species? It's crazy, they will say. I would remind these people that we live in a society in which a corporation, as abstract an entity as one could imagine, is considered a person. So it's not like there is no precedent for a nonhuman being a person. At least an artificial intelligence is an actual thinking being, not just a business arrangement.\n\nBut perhaps we do need to question the definition of personhood. Increasing amounts of evidence regarding the intelligence of elephants or the existence of culture among whales, for example, could be a sign that we need to answer some difficult questions.\n\nWho better to debate these questions with than the young genius who revolutionized the f$§%&$§ &\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Alexandra.AI_feedback.Text=\n\n"We keep discussing what an artificial intelligence would mean to us and how it would change our understanding of the world. That's a great topic and I think we've covered it extensively. What we've barely mentioned, though, is the other side of the coin. I mean, our lives would still be what they were before, A.I. or no A.I. The question I think we should discuss, even if it's all completely hypothetical, is the perspective of the artificial intelligence itself. What would it be like to be that creature? To suddenly come into being, created by others as an experiment? To have all the information about yourself, to know exactly how you function? What would you think about the world? Would you see meaning? Beauty? How would you judge humanity? Where would you see yourself fitting into the grand scheme of things? I think we should try to put ourselves into the shoes of such a being.\n\n&gt; Dear Alexandra: Thank you for your feedback, but this is a philosophy course, not science fiction."\n\nAnd that's why I almost gave up on my studies. :(\n\n

It very well may. But we have to look beyond purely practical questions to the issue of morality. Especially at this turning point of our spiritual ecology.\n\nBy what right can we put living beings through all that suffering, just so they can serve our purposes? Why create these pale imitations of our fatally flawed species and force them to reenact our sordid history? Why &$&//\n\nWhat you are building, Ms. Drennan, is a prison - even if there is a way out. I believe you mean well, but your idea of what is valuable is rooted in the dogma of Western civilization.\n\nWe're lucky enough to be able to end our global crime spree relatively painlessly, if you consider the harm we have caused the Earth. Why not be satisfied with that and let this planet go on in peace?\n\nI hope you heed my words, and let your "Talos" bleed out before it's too late.\n\nRespectfully,\nChellis Jensen\n\n

What they're really worried about is that someone might prove, once and for all, that consciousness can arise from matter. And I kind of understand why they find it so terrifying. If we can create a sentient being, where does that leave the soul? Without mystery, how can we see ourselves as anything other than machines? And if we are machines, what hope do we have that death is not the end?\n\nWhat really scares people is not the artificial intelligence in the computer, but the "natural" intelligence they see in the mirror.\n\n[show next comments]\n\n

But it is difficult to agree with this view. If any idealist philosopher, instead of arriving in time to catch the nine pm train, should turn up two minutes late, he would see the tail of the departing train and would be convinced by his own eyes that time and space are inseparable from material reality. \n\nThe task is to diminish this space, to overcome it, to economize time, to prolong human life, to register past time, to raise life to a higher level and enrich it. This is the reason for the struggle with space and time, at the basis of which lies the struggle to subject matter to man – matter, which constitutes the foundation not only of everything that really exists, but also of all imagination.\n\n[BRONSTEIN, /&\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Chesterton.Brain.Text=\n\nThe human brain is a machine for coming to conclusions; if it cannot come to conclusions it is rusty. When we hear of a man too clever to believe, we are hearing of something having almost the character of a contradiction in terms. It is like hearing of a nail that was too good to hold down a carpet; or a bolt that was too strong to keep a door shut. Man can hardly be defined, after the fashion of Carlyle, as an animal who makes tools; ants and beavers and many other animals make tools, in the sense that they make an apparatus. Man can be defined as an animal that makes dogmas. As he piles doctrine on doctrine and conclusion on conclusion in the formation of some tremendous scheme of philosophy and religion, he is, in the only legitimate sense of which the expression is capable, becoming more and more human. When he drops one doctrine after another in a refined scepticism, when he declines to tie himself to a system, when he says that he has outgrown definitions, when he says that he disbelieves in finality, when, in his own imagination, he sits as God, holding no form of creed but contemplating all, then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass. Trees have no dogmas. Turnips are singularly broad-minded.\n\n

Dick discusses the two themes that are most central to his work: "What is reality?" and "What is an authentic human being?"\n\nHis speculations and experiences will seem extraordinary to a reader unfamiliar with his work, yet despite what may seem like far-fetched ideas - "somehow the world of the Bible is a literally real but veiled landscape, never changing, hidden from our sight, but available to us by revelation," or the notion that perhaps we all exist in the year 50 A.D. - Dick actually delivers one of the simplest, most elegant and most useful definitions of reality ever formulated:\n\n"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."\n\nMaterialist philosophers have expressed similar ideas before (e.g. Straton of Stageira's Talos Principle), but it's particularly interesting to see such a thought expressed by a decidedly more mystical writer, wh#/&$\n\n

And each cloud was a plague unleashed from the Throne of God in the time of the Nephilim; in that age the plagues were buried in the Pit, there to remain until the End of Days, which was surely now come. I fell to my knees and prayed, and before me appeared seven angels, riding their chariots, wheels within wheels turning in the sky, and their light hid the clouds from my sight.\n\nOne angel stepped down onto the Earth, and by his fiery sword I knew him to be Uriel. He spoke, saying: "Seven plagues have awoken in the land, but not at the hand of Elohim; look upon the wages of sin. And shall He send forth the deluge once more, to cleanse the land of this evil?

Being a humble man of little wisdom, I asked: "Great Uriel, we are not allowed to eat from the Tree of Life. How may we then be saved?" And Uriel commanded me to stretch out my hand; and he gave me his fiery sword, which burned my hand, and he said: "Only by sacrifice can you free the world from the dominion of sin."\n\nWith a prayer on my lips, I fell upon Uriel's sword, and it pierced my heart. And truly, on my body, the stigmata of the Lord appeared, dripping blood that was not my blood onto the ground; and the seven heads of the dragon that were crowned in black clouds receded, and light fell upon the Earth, and Jerusalem was born again.

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Eadwald.Tetromino.Text=\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of St. Eadwald's recently-uncovered writings is his preoccupation with finding divine truth in mathematical concepts, which at times borders on pantheism.\n\nHe was, it would seem, particularly concerned with what we now call tetrominoes, seeing in them a reflection of the tetragrammaton and the Greek word for God (TH-E-O-S). Their ability to form other shapes out of themselves symbolized to him the Creator's ability to reshape the world without breaking the laws He himself had established.\n\nEadwald referred to tetrominoes as "sigilla" (sigils), implying that they were a more truthful version of the magical symbols worshipped by heathens, rooted in both the Abrahamic tradition and careful observation of Creation.\n\nIt is unlikely that these texts were distributed, as they would almost certainly have resulted in charges of heresy.\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.General.Evolution.Text=\n\n&lt;favorited by George Jameson&gt;\n\nOne of the common misunderstandings about evolution, sometimes accidentally promoted by people who should know better, is that it's an active process. Sometimes the term "evolve" is even applied to individual beings, as if some invisible force had driven them to suddenly change. But the truth is that individuals don't evolve; the term "evolution" describes a long-term process that can be observed in an entire population across time due to #495445524 #15449 #4F4E& example, in response to an external threat or challenge. \n\nIf an individual coincidentally has a trait that allows it to deal with that challenge more effectively than others, it is more likely to pass on that information to its descendants. That information gives them an advantage, so over time they become the dominant "model" of that species. The individuals experience no (significant) genetic change during their lifetimes, but each of them is part of the evolution of the species.\n\n

Why would a loving God inflict such pain and suffering on good, kind people? If truly there is a personal God... how can He be the same God who will subject those children to such unbearable pain? I remember all the answers we were taught, yet none of them seem believable now.\n\nI don't want to stand in front of people and preach something that I don't feel in my heart. Better to have doubts than to be a hypocrite. And yet I also cannot deny the experience that led me to this vocation. So what is the truth? Perhaps it is that I neglected the mystery of God, used "He moves in mysterious ways" as an excuse rather than as the terrifying acknowledgment it truly is. Perhaps I made God too human.\n\nIf the universe has a purpose, that does not mean that it revolves around us. A sobering thought, but are we not supposed to be humble in the face of the divine?\n\nWith love,\n\n\n

No civilization is authentic, monolithic, pure; the exact opposite is true. Look at your average Western nation: its numbers Arabic, its alphabet Latin, its religion Levantine, its philosophy Greek… need I continue? And each of these examples can itself be broken down further: the Romans got their alphabet from the Greeks, who created theirs by stealing from the Phoenicians, and so on. Our myths and religions, too, are syncretic - sharing, repeating and adapting a large variety of elements to suit their needs. Even the language of our creation, the DNA itself, is impure, defined by a history of amalgamation: not only between nations, but even between different human species!"\n\nTasks:\n1.

TermDlg.FoundTexts.General.Mutation.Name=mutation.html
TermDlg.FoundTexts.General.Mutation.Text=\n\nThe role of mutation in evolution is particularly fascinating. Mutation is essentially an error in the organism's central database: a variable gets changed, a piece of information is accidentally doubled or combined with another. Most of the time, the result is the equivalent of a bug, causing anything from minor problems to complete system shutdown (i.e. death). But sometimes the new information is functional, giving the organism an advantage against the challenges it faces, in which case it has a much higher chance of being passed to the next generation.\n\nIf you consider how unlikely a beneficial mutation is, and how long it takes for such a mutation to propagate, this process can give you an amazing insight into just how vast the genetic history of each living organism 4C494 ?(6452 OVERWRITE 0465 24 F4D204 5525 24F52 Simultaneously, it is intriguing to consider what a major role random errors have played in the evolution of life itself.

TermDlg.FoundTexts.General.PhilosophyTeeth.Text=\n\nLast night I had a simple but brilliant idea. Everyone who would like to write about philosophy or spirituality, especially to make some kind of grand statement about the nature of the body and the soul, should first experience a really bad tooth infection. I don't just mean a slight toothache, I mean the kind of hardcore infection that happens when several incompetent dentists miss a cavity in one of your back teeth and the thing keeps growing and growing until the nerve itself is really badly infected.\n\nI mean, the pain is *unimaginable*. It comes in waves, and these waves drown out everything else about you. You can't talk, you can't move, you can't think, there's just pain and absolutely nothing else. It's like your brain just gets hijacked by it.\n\nAnd then? You go to the dentist, and (assuming you get a decent one) they stick some chemicals in you, which make you go numb. Then they drill a hole in you, cut the nerve - snip snip - and it's over. Just like that, like repairing a car or a watch. Your whole existence was crippled by this tiny, tiny nerve sending electrochemical signals into your brain, and this unimaginable pain, which nearly blotted out your very consciousness, can be stopped just by a little cut.\n\nWe should call this the Toothos Principle, but that's incredibly stupid.\n\n

And if we've contributed a little to the future of humanity, what can we feel but gratitude?\n\nIt is a true privilege to have had such insights into the nature of the mind; neither of us believes in God, but we certainly experienced a sense of awe that could be compared to a kind of religious feeling, at least according to Einstein's understanding of God. We've chosen to go now, together, because it means less suffering; one last beautiful day together seems a much better ending than a slow wasting away. In a sense, it's just mathematics.\n\nLove,\nAlan & George\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.IAN.QuestioningDoubt.Name=questioning_doubt_conf.txt
TermDlg.FoundTexts.IAN.QuestioningDoubt.Text=\n\nKeynote Speech by N. Sarabhai, "Questioning Doubt"\n\nThey say "doubt everything," but I disagree. Doubt is useful in small amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion. No, don't doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That's the real trick. Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you'll doubt evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you'll end up with nothing, because doubt doesn't give anything back. But questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you'll find that a lot of what we believe is untrue… but you might also discover that some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And then you'll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.\n\nQuestioning is a lifelong process. That's precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?e #%&%§/$ \n\nQuestioning is progress, but doubt is stagnation.\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.IAN.Transcendence.Text=\n\nReader responses to last week's article on science and atheism:\n\n"I am perfectly aware of all the arguments against religion. In fact, I agree with most of them! There is no question that there is an objective, material reality. I'm also absolutely convinced that only a secular society can be truly equal and just.\n\nAnd yet, I believe. I am, as they say, a person of faith.\n\nReligion, to me, is not about distorting observable reality with superstitions, but about *transcendence*. It's not about deluding ourselves that the Earth is 6000 years old or God will help us if we say the right words inside our heads, but about reaching out to the Sublime. This is not a rejection of reason, but its application to a set of experiences that cannot be approached by more traditional means.\n\nTrue engagement with religion is humbling. It transcends culture, nationality, and gender. As such, I think it goes hand in hand with science, and is not opposed to it."\n\n- Dr. Omar Gharib, Institute for Applied Noematics\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Kant.SecondThesis.Text=\n\nIn Man (as the only rational creature on Earth), those natural predispositions which are intended for the use of his reason, should be completely developed only in the species, not in the individual.\n\nReason in a creature is a faculty for extending the rules and purposes of the use of its powers far beyond natural instinct, and knows no limits in its designs. Yet it does not act according to instinct, but requires trials, practice and instruction, in order to progress from one degree of insight to the next.\n\nTherefore each human would have to live excessively long in order to learn how he could make full use of his natural capacities; or, if Nature had given him only a short term of life (as she indeed has), so she would require a perhaps unpredictable series of generations, each passing its enlightenment to the next, to finally develop her seeds in our species to the degree that she considers appropriate.\n\nAnd that point in time must be, at least as an idea, the goal of man's efforts, for otherwise his natural capacities would have to be regarded as largely meaningless #&& [KANT, IMMANUEL]\n\n

While the Library of Alexandria burned at the hands of fanatics and conquerors, depriving us of unimaginable insights into history, philosophy and art, the papers carelessly thrown away by the citizens of Oxyrhynchus survived to the modern day. And though it is true that a great deal of what we know today is because of the conscious efforts of individual and organizations (such as the spectacular translation and preservation work done during the Islamic Golden Age), so much more is simply the result of coincidence and luck.\n\nWe've lost texts that the ancients considered to be absolutely essential, while utterly trivial - even plagiarized - work has survived unharmed! 4C 49 46 45 20 49 4E 20 44 45 41 54 48 20 42 45 47 49 4E 53 20 41 4E 45 57 So if we want our descendants to remember more than glittering emo-vampires and autotuned teen pop stars, we have to invest in %$&make sure that %§&$ $%$& §""!!$§%\n\n

TermDlg.FoundTexts.Osiris.Wiki.Text=\n\nThe Book of the Scribe of Osiris (sometimes also referred to as the Book of the Journey to Aaru) is an Ancient Egyptian text discovered in the excavation of Oxyrhynchus. It has caused a certain degree of controversy among Egyptologists, as some argue that it is a classic funerary text such as the Book of Coming Forth by Day, while others believe it to be a poetic work not intended to be understood literally.\n\nThe book tells the story of a dying man who asks a scribe about the afterlife. The scribe, a servant of Osiris, describes how the man's Ka (life force) will become separated from his Ba (personality), and how he will have to reunite the two and become an Akh (living intellect), passing a series of trials in the Duat (underworld) in order to reach the paradise of Aaru. Unlike similar texts, the Book of the Scribe of Osiris focuses less on giving advice or /&#\n\nA recent study (Carnahan/Hassan) suggests the text may have been intended as philosophical commentary on the world of the living through the allegory of the Duat. It remains unclear whether this was the intent of the original pre-Alexandrian author or a result of the later translation into Greek. The earlier manuscript, which is considered to be more authentic, is too fragmentary to provide answers, though perhaps further excavation may %&$/§\n\n
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Beginnings.Name=beginnings.txt
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Beginnings.Text=\n\nStraton of Stageira, On Beginnings (Fragment)\n\nIt is the grave error of many philosophers, not only of the Athenian schools but also of many others, that they begin not with observation of the cosmos as it surrounds us, but with a conclusion already in mind; and often that conclusion is that the world was created ideal, and mankind itself the greatest creation of the gods. Yet neither the world nor the gods owe mankind perfection; it is arrogance itself to presume so, and contrary to all the methods of philosophy. The honest philosopher seeks only the Truth, even if it bears no comfort; and he must begin by assuming, as Socrates said, that all he knows is that he knows nothing.\n\n74 68 65 20 75 6E 65 78 61 6D 69 6E 65 64 20 6C 69 66 65 20 69 73 20 6E 6F 74 20 77 6F 72 74 68 20 6C 69 76 69 6E 67\n\n

What seemingly enraged many of his contemporaries and a significant number of later thinkers is the principle's simplicity and unassailability, which (according to a fragment found in Miletus) "cut through their rhetorical webs, which sought to tangle the listener with fanciful words and thoughts of the heavens, like Alexander's sword through the Gordian Knot." \n\nDiogenes Laertius makes mention of a dialogue by Anaximander of Chalcedon that expanded greatly on the Talos Principle, but that work remains lost.\n\n
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Talos.Name=talos_principle.txt
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Talos.Text=\n\n[ARCHIVE: 260BCE-F12] [STRATON OF STAGEIRA]\n\nWhether it is true that Daedalus constructed the giant Talos, or as others say he was the creation of Hephaestus, what we may be certain of is that he was made of bronze, and had but one vein, within which flowed a liquid substance like blood, which some claim was quicksilver, and others assert was ichor such as flows in the veins of the gods. The loss of that liquid caused him to die, as a man dies when he loses his blood.\n\nMay we not then say that Talos, though created as a machine or a toy, had all the essential properties of a man? He moved of his own volition. He spoke and could be spoken to, had wishes and desires. Indeed in the tale of the Argonauts, that was the cause of his downfall. If, then, a machine may have all the properties of a man, and act as a man while driven only by the ingenious plan of its construction and the interaction of its materials according to the principles of nature, then does it not follow that man may also be seen as a machine? This contradicts all the schools of metaphysics, yet even the most faithful philosopher cannot live without his blood.\n\n
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Wiki.Name=straton_of_stageira.wiki
TermDlg.FoundTexts.Straton.Wiki.Text=\n\nSTRATON of Stageira (311 - 254 BC) was a Greek materialist philosopher associated with the Peripatetic school. An admirer of Aristotle, he was a proponent of empiricism and a fierce critic of philosophy that placed belief before observable truths. Though unpopular with many of his peers for his often acerbic personal manner, his commentaries on Aristotle were considered an important work. Much of his writing was lost in the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.\n\n
